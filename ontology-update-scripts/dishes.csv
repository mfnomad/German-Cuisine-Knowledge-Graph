Name,Description
Brezel,"Considered an iconic symbol of Germany, the pretzel is a type of traditional baked good that is made by combining flour, salt, malt, yeast, and water. The resulting dough is then shaped into a well-known knotted shape of a pretzel before it is baked. Pretzels are often dipped in a lye solution (natronlauge in German) before they are baked, and then they are called laugenbrezel, a Bavarian-style pretzel distinguished by a nice, brown, and crispy exterior that surrounds the soft interior. Coarse salt is usually sprinkled over the surface of the pretzels, but other toppings may also be used, including sesame, pumpkin, sunflower, or poppy seeds. Regional variations of the pretzel abound, with some of them using fat to obtain a softer dough and others calling for different types of flour such as whole wheat flour or spelt flour. German pretzels come in both sweet and savory versions, and their texture may range from soft to hard. They are usually enjoyed warm as a snack with butter or along with German wurst sausages and a cold German beer on the side for an authentic German experience. The pretzel is a favorite street snack and a staple at any festival, holiday, and Christmas market in the country. Its versatile nature has given rise to numerous variations including New Year’s pretzels (neujahrbrezel), Oktoberfest pretzels (also called wiesnbrezn), and Lent pretzels (fastenbrezeln), among many others. In Alsace, France, the pretzel is known as bretzel d'Alsace."
Bratwurst,"What was once an item for survival during the cold winter months and a technique of not wasting meat scraps is nowadays a delicacy consumed throughout Germany and abroad. Bratwurst stems from two words, an Old High German word brat, meaning meat without waste, and wurst, which means sausage. Bratwurst has origins with the Celtics, but the Franconians developed it further. It dates back to the 1300s in a region that would eventually become Eastern Germany. Bratwurst is usually consumed for breakfast, due to the tradition of farmers who would make the sausages in the morning and eat them by noon, as they would otherwise spoil. Technically, a bratwurst must be made from either pork, veal, or beef, but there are more than 40 varieties of the sausage throughout Germany. The oldest recipe for bratwurst was discovered in 2000 by a historian named Heinrich Höllerlhas. The same recipe, for the Thuringian bratwurst (one of the most famous varieties), says that the makers had to use only the purest, unspoiled meat in the production process. Today, bratwursts are commonly served with sauerkraut, potato salad, horseradish, or mustard in Germany, but the sausages are also popular in the United States, especially in Wisconsin, where they are commonly found at summer cookouts and barbecues."
Schwarzwaelder Kirschtorte,"Black Forest cherry cake is a popular German dessert consisting of chocolate sponges that are coated in whipped cream and dotted with kirschwasser-infused cherries. Some varieties use the kirschwasser brandy to soak the chocolate layers or to lightly flavor the whipped cream. When assembled, the cake is lavishly decorated with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and cherries. Among the numerous theories about its invention, it is still debated whether the cake was created by confectioner Josef Keller or pastry chef Erwin Hildenbrand. What is certain is that Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte originated in the Black Forest area and was in all likelihood modeled on the colors of the regional folk dresses. Since its first appearance in written form in 1934, it has become a well-known German dessert that is enjoyed throughout the country.  "
Lebkuchen,"This traditional German treat is mainly associated with Christmas and winter holidays. The term lebkuchen covers a wide variety of different types of honey or ginger-flavored cookies which are traditionally baked on oblaten (thin wafers), and glazed or coated with either dark chocolate or sugar icing. Additional ingredients may include various spices like cloves, aniseed, nutmeg, coriander, and cardamom, with different types of nuts or candied fruit. Best-known varieties of this cookie include the heart-shaped lebkuchenherzen which are often decorated with icing and different inscriptions, the German version of the gingerbread man called honigkuchenpferd (lit. honey cake horse), and hexenhausel (lit. witch’s house), while the most famous is the Nurnberger Elisenlebkuchen. In Germany, the earliest records date back to the year 1296 and the city of Ulm, and the year 1395 and the city of Nurnberg. The area itself was an intersection of many trade routes that supplied it with spices necessary and thus helped to keep the production of lebkuchen alive and thriving. In 1996, the Nurnberger lebkuchen was granted the protected designation of origin (PDO) status which applies to all the lebkuchen produced in the city of Nurnberg."
Stollen,"Stollen is one of German Christmas classics. This rich fruit bread is prepared with a buttery and sweet yeast dough that is usually spiced, lemon-flavored, and enriched with various dried fruits and marzipan. Though it may appear in different forms, it is usually oblong and covered with generous amounts of melted butter and powdered sugar. Among the different varieties, Dresdner stollen is considered as the oldest and the most popular version, whose origins date back to the 15th century. Originally, stollen was plain and prepared only with flour, yeast, and oil, and it was only in 1490, when the Pope Innocent VIII lifted the ban on baking with butter during Advent, that the stollen started to develop into a dense and rich cake that is known today."
Sauerbraten,"The traditional German pot roast is one of the best ways to transform more tougher cuts of beef into a tender, succulent meal. Chuck and bottom round are most favored cuts for this German classic, while the key to a perfect sauerbraten is in its lengthy marinade of red wine, tart vinegar, and spices, which tenderizes the meat infusing it with sharp, tangy flavors. After long hours of braising, the remaining cooking liquid is whisked into einbrenne (roux), and finally simmered into a thick, brown gravy. Sauerbraten is traditionally served with German favorites such as spätzle egg noodles, bread dumplings, or boiled potatoes and a side of braised or roasted red cabbage."
Leberkaese,"Leberkäse is a traditional product consisting of ground meat that is flavored with onions and baked into a meatloaf. The loaf is characterized by a crispy crust on the exterior, while the interior remains juicy and pink. The dish can be served either hot or cold, and it is recommended to pair it with mustard and bread, while some like to fry the slices of meatloaf in a pan and consume it as a quick snack."
Currywurst,"No other dish in Germany is as well known as currywurst, a street snack that has become an indispensable part of Germany’s culinary heritage. The dish is made from two essential parts - boiled and subsequently fried sausage, served whole or sliced, and a smooth and rich curry-spiced tomato sauce. With a portion of french fries or a kaiser roll on the side, the dish is usually lightly dusted with yellow curry powder. A wide range of sausages are used for currywurst, but the famous German bratwurst is the most commonly used variety. The real star of this dish is its gravy-like sauce made with puréed tomatoes and infused with the aromatic curry powder. The popularity of currywurst in Germany has generated numerous legends about its origins. Even though Hamburg is sometimes mentioned as its birthplace, Berlin is the city that is most commonly associated with the invention of this delicious dish. The most famous legend tells the story of Herta Heuwer, a Berlin local who is widely credited as the inventor of the tomato and curry concoction. In 1949, amid the aftermath of World War II, many ingredients were hard to come by and life was tough. However, thanks to Herta’s negotiating skills, she was able to get hold of a hard to come by ingredient –  British yellow curry powder. She then mixed it with puréed tomatoes and other spices to create the base sauce, which she served with the sliced sausage. The dish became an instant success. Herta patented her creation and never revealed her original recipe. Later, as currywurst grew in popularity, numerous varieties popped up all over Berlin and the rest of Germany. No two are the same, and every local has their own favorite style and a favorite currywurst place. Germans are so fond of this fast food staple that they have even built a museum in its honor. Located in Berlin, the Currywurst Museum offers a glimpse into the history of the legendary currywurst, as well as a detailed overview of the numerous varieties, cooking styles, and serving options of this famous dish."
Weisswuerste,"Weisswurst or white sausage is a famous specialty of the city of Munich, invented in 1857 by a butcher named Sepp Moser. He was working in a restaurant next to his butcher's shop and had used the last of thick sausage skins used to make regular sausages. To solve the problem, he opted for thin skins. As he made the sausage, he was worried that it would burst open during the frying process, so he put them in hot water and cooked them for 10 minutes. After serving the cooked sausages to the guests, the new dish was praised, and Weisswurst was born. The sausages consist of a mixture of pork, veal, and pork fat, seasoned with parsley, pepper, lemon, and salt. Today, the sausages are most popular in southern Germany, and they are one of the most consumed items at Oktoberfest. In restaurants, Weisswurst is always served hot, usually accompanied by pretzels and, ideally, Händlmaier's Hausmacher Senf, although it can be served with other Bavarian sweet mustard varieties if the original Händlmeier brand is unavailable. The sausage casing is not intended for consumption, so the sausages are often sliced along their length, and the casing is peeled. Interestingly, it is considered a taboo to eat Weisswurst after noon in Bavaria. This tradition stems from the past when the sausages were made fresh, and were supposed to be consumed as quickly as possible. "
Rouladen,"Rouladen are traditional German meat rolls stuffed with a variety of ingredients. They are always served accompanied by a creamy sauce. The rolls are usually made with long and thin beef steaks, which are pounded, generously seasoned, and usually covered with a layer of sharp German mustard, which flavors them and keeps the meat juicy and tender. Traditional stuffing inside rouladen usually incorporates thin strips of bacon and sliced pickles, but there are many different regional combinations which might include carrots, onion, or bread. The steaks are typically rolled into small logs and secured with toothpicks. Rouladen are shortly seared on all sides, then braised in a flavorful mixture of wine and vegetable or meat broth. The same broth, commonly thickened with flour, is usually used as the base for a velvety sauce accompanying the rolls. Potato dumplings, braised red cabbage, mashed potatoes, spätzle, different vegetables, or soft boiled potatoes can all be served as side dishes with this German classic. Even though it is believed that the name roulade derives from the French rouler, which means to roll, this delicacy is considered to be an authentic German dish."
Schweinebraten,"Schweinebraten is a traditional pork roast originating from Bavaria. It is typically prepared for Sunday lunch and consists of sliced pork roast that's served with homemade gravy, semmelknödel (bread dumplings) or potato dumplings, and either sauerkraut or rotkohl (red cabbage). When properly prepared, the meat should be succulent and very tender. The best part of pork to use for this dish is boneless pork shoulder. Before the preparation, pork is often rubbed with mustard, marjoram, or minced garlic, giving it a bit of extra flavor. For the best possible experience, it is recommended to pair the dish with a cold German beer on the side, preferably a lager."
Bayrisch Creme,"This rich, silky egg custard is thickened with gelatin and combined with whipped cream. It is traditionally served cold, and is usually garnished with pieces of fresh fruit or drizzled over with sweet sauces. Although its origins are quite unclear, it is known that Bavarian cream hails from either Germany or France. Many French chefs worked in Bavaria during the 17th and 18th century, so it is believed that they learned the recipe there. Some believe that the dish was invented by a famous French chef Marie-Antoine Carême, who wrote a recipe for it in the early 18th century. Today, Bavarian cream is consumed on its own as a decadent dessert or used as a filling for various cakes and pastries."
Leberwurst,"Leberwurst is a spicy German sausage consisting of a combination of ground pork liver, onions, and spices. The sausage is traditionally consumed with sauerkraut, although it can also be used in sandwiches, where leberwurst is sliced and paired with cheese, mustard, pickles, and bread. It might be cooked, but most leberwurst varieties are spreadable and can be consumed uncooked. Apart from Germany and Austria, this sausage is popular in many other countries such as Slovenia, Serbia, and Romania, and today there are many varieties of leberwurst, with additions such as mushrooms and cowberries."
Kaesespaetzle,"Käsespätzle is a simple noodle dish that combines spätzle noodles with a creamy mixture of melted cheese. The noodles are also called knöpfle, meaning little buttons, and are made with eggs, flour, milk or water, and seasonings such as salt, pepper and (sometimes) nutmeg, while käse refers to the melted cheese mixture, which is usually a combination of two or more types of cheese such as Edam, Gouda, Fontina, Gruyère, Appenzeller, or Emmental cheese. The noodle mixture is typically pressed through a specially designed spoon or colander directly into boiling salted water and cooked until done before it is mixed with the melted cheese. Also referred to as käsknöpfle, the dish is typically enjoyed with additional grated cheese and caramelized onions on top, and typical accompaniments include apple sauce, potato salad, and fresh green salads. Versions of this dish are traditionally consumed in Southern Germany, Swabia, Austria, and Liechtenstein, and it's also a typical dish in Switzerland, Hungary, Alsace, Moselle, and South Tyrol. "
Schweinshaxe,"The term Schweinshaxe is typically used in the southern parts of Germany, predominantly in Bavaria, and it usually refers to a whole pork knuckle that is roasted for hours until it is thoroughly cooked and the skin becomes golden brown and crispy. Pork knuckles are a staple in traditional German cuisine, and they come with various names such as hachse, haxe, haxn, knöchla, hechse, hämmchen, and bötel, mainly depending on the region and a slightly different preparation process. Eisbein is the northern version of the dish that is typically cured or pickled and then boiled. Though it is commonly found in restaurants throughout the country and the region, Schweinshaxe is a quintessential dish at the popular folk festival Oktoberfest. The knuckle is almost always served whole, and it's usually accompanied by sauerkraut, braised cabbage, roasted potatoes, or potato dumplings. Similar dishes are found in other European countries, such as pečené vepřové koleno in the Czech Republic. "
Pumpernickel,"This heavy and slightly sweet rye bread is made from a sourdough starter and coarsely ground rye with whole rye berries as its base. Its name comes from the German pumpern, a synonym for being flatulent, and the male given name Nickel—a form of the name Nicholas—which was commonly associated with the devil in New High German vernacular. Thus, pumpernickel literally translates to ""devil’s fart,"" which is a definition accepted by most publishers and dictionaries, however strange it may sound. The traditional German pumpernickel contains no coloring agents, but instead relies on the Maillard reaction to impart a deep brown color and a sweet, almost chocolatey and earthy flavor and aroma. Apart from being delicious, pumpernickel is rich in resistant starch which is known to aid digestion and benefit blood sugar regulation."
Obazda,"This Bavarian cheese spread was originally invented to make use of ripened soft cheese. It consists of a creamy combination of butter, paprika, and typically Camembert and Brie, or optionally Romadur, Limburger, and sometimes even cottage cheese. The spread is usually enriched with onions or shallots, caraway, or various herbs, while some versions may include beer, wine, or milk-based products. It is believed that obazda was popularized in the 1920s by Katharina Eisenreich, who served it at her Braustuberl pub in Freising. Nowadays, the spread is a Bavarian staple that is served in numerous restaurants and pubs, usually alongside pretzels and various snacks."
Semmelknoedel,"Semmelknödel are popular German bread dumplings–nutritious and convenient, they are one of the most versatile side dishes in traditional German cuisine. Even though there are numerous semmelknödel varieties, which come in various sizes, they all have a recognizable round form and employ bread as the base ingredient. Sliced or diced bread pieces, which can be fried in oil, are usually soaked in plain milk to soften, then mixed with eggs to form a pliable, soft base. Since they are incredibly neutral on their own, bread dumplings are usually mixed with different spices and additional ingredients to form a myriad of flavorful varieties. They commonly include onions and fresh herbs such as parsley or marjoram, but can even withstand strong flavors coming from nutmeg or fresh lemon zest. Even though semmelknödel are mostly served as a complement to various roast meat dishes and stews, they can be enjoyed as a nourishing dish on their own, usually served alongside vegetables and lentils, or doused in creamy mushroom sauces. Various dumplings are omnipresent in many European cuisines, but the invention of semmelknödel has usually been associated with the German region of Bavaria, from where it spread to other parts of Germany and countries such as Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic."
Jaegerschnitzel,"Jägerschnitzel is a traditional version of schnitzel that is topped with a gravy called Jägersoße, meaning hunter's sauce. Originally made with venison or wild boar, nowadays the most common types of meat used for this dish are pork or veal. In some regions of Germany, the meat cutlets are not breaded, but simply pounded until thin, then seasoned, and cooked. The delicious gravy that accompanies the schnitzel is made with mushrooms, bacon, onions, a splash of wine, and spices such as thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Spätzle or various potato dishes and salads are most commonly served alongside this dish."
Kartoffelsuppe,"Kartoffelsuppe is a popular German soup made with potatoes as its key ingredient. The soup is usually cooked with the addition of onions, celery, butter, and milk. It is characterized by a very thick consistency. This soup is a specialty of the Baden region, traditionally served at harvest time, when it is often accompanied by plum cake. In other German regions, Kartoffelsuppe is often consumed with steamed dumplings. In some varieties of the soup, such as the Berlin Kartoffelsuppe, it is recommended to garnish the dish with croutons and parsley."
Kaesekuchen,"German-style cheesecake is a traditional dessert consisting of a thin layer of shortcrust pastry that is topped with a creamy combination of quark cheese, eggs, and (occasionally) various fruits. Even though käsekuchen is often compared to the classic American cheesecake, the use of lightly acidic quark cheese results in a light, scrumptious treat that perfectly combines sweet and sour flavors. Usually served dusted with powdered sugar, käsekuchen is a classic German dessert that is commonly enjoyed as an everyday treat alongside coffee or tea."
Wiesn Hendl,"Wiesn Hendl is the Bavarian roasted chicken, traditionally seasoned only with salt and sometimes parsley, then grilled and sold as half a chicken or whole chicken. During the roasting process, the chicken is often doused with melted butter. It can be found in many beer gardens and it is especially popular during Oktoberfest. When served, hendl is usually accompanied by potato salad or large pretzels called brezn."
Spaghettieis,"Spaghettieis is a traditional ice cream that’s made to look like a bowl of spaghetti with tomato sauce and grated parmesan cheese. This dessert was invented in Mannheim, Germany in 1969 by Dario Fontanella, the son of an ice cream making Italian immigrant. In order to prepare it, he pushed vanilla gelato through a spaetzle press on a dollop of whipped cream, then topped it with strawberry syrup and white chocolate shavings. A cookie or wafer is often placed on the side to mimic a piece of Italian bread. Nowadays, spaghettieis can be bought at almost every ice cream parlor, known as eisdiele, because Fontanella didn’t patent his invention. Today, there are different spaghettieis flavors such as banana, chocolate, kiwi, or melon. "
Kartoffelpuffer,"German potato pancakes are a restaurant staple, a homemade classic, and a popular street food snack. They are prepared with a thick batter that employs grated raw potatoes, flour, and eggs, and are usually shaped into flat, round discs that are shortly pan-fried until golden and crispy. Even though they are often served as a complement to stews, grilled meat, and sausages, potato pancakes make an excellent snack or main course. Kartoffelpuffers are traditionally accompanied by creamy apple sauce, fruit preserves, or sour cream."
Baumkuchen,"The German version of spit cake, known as baumkuchen, is just one of many similar cakes found throughout Europe. There are various conflicting theories about its origin—one points in the direction of a German town called Salzwedel in the 19th century, while others say it’s a descendant of the Hungarian wedding cake. The batter–typically made from flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and butter–is thinly coated on a spit that’s rotating over a heat source. Before each new layer is applied, the previous one must be fully dry. Once sliced, the cake has a lovely texture and appearance which resembles growth rings, hence its name–baumkuchen or tree cake. The basic dough can be enriched by various ingredients such as nuts, honey, and brandy. The cake is often additionally coated with sugar or chocolate glaze. Miniature, cut up slices of this cake - called baumkuchenspitzen or tree cake tips - are usually glazed in chocolate and sold individually."
Apfelkuchen,"German apple cake is a delightful combination of dense, buttery dough and sliced, halved, or diced apples. Depending on the region, the cake is often dusted with cinnamon sugar, covered in crumbly streusel, or doused in vanilla-flavored custard. Traditionally baked in round tins, sliced apple cake is usually enjoyed as a filling afternoon dessert that is often paired with coffee or tea."
Bratkartoffeln,"Pan-fried potatoes are a classic, versatile German dish that is easily adapted with additional ingredients and comes in different flavor combinations. The potatoes are traditionally diced or sliced, buttered and salted, and can be then combined with bacon, ham, onions, vegetables, and a variety of fresh herbs and spices. The key is to achieve crispy, golden potatoes that stay soft and tender on the inside. Simple and affordable, bratkartoffeln is a common restaurant dish as well as a popular home-cooked meal that is usually served as an accompaniment to roasted or grilled meat, sausages, fish, or fried eggs."
Bockwurst,"Bockwurst is one of the most common sausage varieties enjoyed in Germany. The sausages were originally prepared with finely ground veal, but today they can employ various types of meat and numerous combinations of spices and fresh herbs. They come in different shapes and are usually pale in color. Bockwursts are typically stuffed in natural casings, which makes them perfect for simmering in hot water or grilling. According to a popular belief, they were invented in Berlin in 1889 by a pub owner named Richard Scholtz, who served them alongside bock bier. Today, they are internationally famous and especially favored in Germany and Austria, where they are usually enjoyed with a dollop of mustard, sauerkraut, or boiled potatoes on the side."
Quarkbaellchen,"Quarkbällchen, meaning quark balls, is a traditional snack that is typically made by combining quark, flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla sugar, and baking powder. Milk, melted butter, cinnamon, lemon zest, and corn or potato starch are also sometimes added to the combination. The quark mixture is shaped into small balls which are deep-fried until golden brown on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Once done, the fried balls are usually coated in powdered or granulated sugar or a cinnamon-sugar mixture. Thought to hail from Bavaria, this sweet treat is generally enjoyed as an afternoon snack alongside a cup of tea or coffee. Resembling donuts, quarkbällchen are available in bakeries throughout Germany, and they’re often prepared during the festive Christmas season, New Year’s Eve, Fasching (Germany’s carnival season), and Oktoberfest."
Nuernberger Bratwuerste,"Nürnberger Bratwürste are small, thin sausages originating from the city of Nürnberg in the Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany. They are typically about 7 to 9 centimeters (2.75 to 3.5 inches) long and weigh around 20 to 25 grams each, making them much smaller and thinner compared to other types of German sausages. The sausages are made from finely ground pork, often mixed with a blend of spices that typically includes marjoram, salt, pepper, and sometimes a hint of ginger or nutmeg, with marjoram being a signature ingredient that gives them their distinctive flavor. Nürnberger Bratwürste are usually grilled over a beechwood fire, which imparts a unique, smoky flavor, but they can also be pan-fried or cooked in a skillet. Traditionally, they are served in sets of six, eight, or twelve, often accompanied by sauerkraut or potato salad, or in a bread roll with mustard, known as ""Drei im Weckla"" (three in a roll). These sausages are a traditional delicacy with a history that dates back centuries, and they are protected under European Union law with a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), meaning they must be produced within the city of Nuremberg to be labeled as Nürnberger Bratwürste."
Blutwurst,"Belonging to the category of cooked sausages, blutwurst is a famous German blood sausage with many regional varieties. It is predominantly made with pork and incorporates animal blood, fat, and meat, next to a wide variety of seasonings such as marjoram, allspice, and thyme. Blutwurst comes in various sizes, and many regional versions include barley, oats, or bread, while some varieties may even consist of diced bacon or innards. Since this blood sausage is typically cooked, it has a firm consistency and is commonly enjoyed as an appetizer alongside other cold cuts. It is usually shortly boiled or fried and served warm, often complemented by mashed potatoes or sauerkraut on the side."
Fischbroetchen,"Fischbrötchen is a commonly consumed sandwich in Northern Germany, made with fish and a variety of other ingredients such as pickles, remoulade, onions, lettuce, or horseradish.

Depending on the variation, the dumplings may consist of cooked potatoes, raw potatoes, or a combination of both. The potato mixture can further be enhanced with the addition of other ingredients such as beaten eggs, potato starch, cornstarch, or flour, and herbs such as chives or parsley, while some versions also call for filling the dumplings with croutons, sauerkraut, or ham. Potato dumplings typically come in the shape of balls, and they are usually simmered in salted water, although they can optionally be pan-seared in butter for added flavor and texture. A common variation of potato dumplings is the one from Thuringia called Thüringer klöße, a type of dumplings made with raw and cooked potatoes containing a filling of toasted bread cubes. In Germany, potato dumplings are a staple accompaniment to dishes such as roasted and braised meat specialties with sauces, sauerbraten, sauerkraut, braised red cabbage, goulash, and rouladen."
Spanferkel,"Spanferkel is the German version of roasted suckling pig. Whether it is prepared cut or whole, the piglet is usually roasted in the oven or on a spit, and comes in numerous regional varieties that are often smothered in oil or butter, stuffed, then seasoned or rubbed with spices.

These small meatballs have been prepared and consumed in that part of Europe for more than 200 years. The term frikadelle is German, and there are also many frikadeller sold as street food in Germany, Poland, and throughout Scandinavia. Frikadelle are typically served with boiled potatoes and traditional creamy sauces (for example, Danish brown sauce) on the side, a dish that is usually enjoyed as a hearty weekend meal. Pickled vegetables, mustard, rye bread, potato salad and a variety of other vegetables can also be served alongside frikadeller. However, modern versions use frikadeller in the creation of new dishes such as frikadeller sandwich or frikadeller smørrebrød."
Kartoffelsalat,"Kartoffelsalat is a traditional potato salad hailing from the region of Swabia in Southern Germany. It typically consists of boiled and sliced potatoes, chopped onions, beef broth, white vinegar, oil, mild German mustard, sugar, and pepper. Although the ingredients of this salad are quite simple, they need to be chosen carefully to achieve the best results. Strong beef broth is the most traditional, but chicken or even vegetable stock may also be used instead. As the salad’s flavor is said to improve with time, it is often prepared a day ahead of consumption. Swabian potato salad is traditionally garnished with fresh chives on top, and it typically accompanies German sausages. Kartoffelsalat can be found on the menus of any restaurant in Germany, and it's also regularly available in grocery stores."
Weihnachtsgans,"Weihnachtsgans is a traditional German roasted goose that's prepared for Christmas. The goose is typically filled with onions, prunes, chestnuts, apples, and/or dates. It is also often stuffed with a dough or meat filling. It's seasoned with salt, pepper, thyme, and marjoram in most cases. Once prepared, the goose is served with simple staples such as dumplings, spätzle, red cabbage, and gravy. It's believed that the practice of this dish stems from an old Catholic custom – on St.Martins Day (November 11th), a Martins-goose is prepared, and when the fasting period ends, on Christmas Eve, another goose was prepared to celebrate, called Weihnachtsgans."
Gaensebraten,"Gänsebraten is a traditional roast specialty consisting of a whole goose that has been brined, stuffed, and roasted to perfection.

Slices of succulent roast goose are the best when paired with sides such as braised red cabbage (Rotkohl), gravy, apple puree, potato dumplings (Kartoffelklöße) or bread dumplings (Semmelknödel), potato salad (Kartoffelsalat), roasted chestnuts, sauerkraut, and spätzle. In Germany, roast goose is traditionally prepared for festive occasions, especially for St. Martin’s Day and Christmas Eve. The roast goose specialty that is usually enjoyed on Christmas Eve has its own name - weihnachtgans or Christmas goose - and it is typically accompanied by potato dumplings and braised red cabbage with apples."
Zwiebelkuchen,"Although it translates to onion cake, German zwiebelkuchen is better described as a savory onion pie. The base of the dish is a thin, buttery crust that is usually made with yeasted dough. The center of the pie is filled with a combination of caramelized onions, smoky bacon, and a creamy mixture of eggs and sour cream. The pie is usually spiced with salt, pepper, and caraway seeds, which give the dish a deep and earthy flavor. Even though there are several varieties of zwiebelkuchen, it is traditionally baked as a round deep-dish pie. In the past, this savory delicacy was made with sour milk and plain bread dough–common staples in many German households. Today it comes in many shapes, including the usual flat, rectangular form, and can be adapted with many ingredients such as leeks and cottage cheese. It is commonly prepared at home but can be found in many German restaurants across the country. Zwiebelkuchen is commonly consumed during the annual grape harvest, and it is recommended to pair it with traditional young wines."
Eisbein,"Eisbein is a German dish, traditionally served in Berlin. The name, which when translated means ice leg refers to a pork knuckle or pork hock which is first cured or pickled and then boiled with vegetables and herbs. In Berlin, the hock is served bone-in on a bed of sauerkraut accompanied by mashed potatoes or pea puree, usually with some mustard on the side. A similar dish exists in Poland – the golonka, which was probably influenced by the traditional Berliner eisbein."
Bienenstich,"This classic German cake consists of a creamy filling that is enclosed between two layers of yeasted pastry dough. The cake is topped with a gooey combination of sugar or honey, cream, and slivered almonds, while the fillings typically include sweetened whipped cream or crème pâtissière. When baked, the honey-almond glaze is caramelized and gives the cake a glossy, crispy top. This sweet treat, which translates as bee sting cake, was allegedly named after the fact that bees were attracted to the sweet, honey-based glaze."
Schaeufele,"Schäufele is a traditional dish from the south of Germany, using pig’s shoulder as the main ingredient. Depending on the region, the meat can be cured and smoked beforehand, seasoned, and then it is either roasted or boiled. Additional ingredients may include various spices, onions, and root vegetables. A typical Franconian version of the dish is served with gravy, potato dumplings, and a salad on the side, while the smoked and cured version from Baden is usually accompanied by a potato salad."
Franzbroetchen,"This delicious German sweet pastry is traditionally served with a cup of coffee on the side. Initially made only in the Hamburg area, it is now also available in other German cities. The original recipe for these little pastries includes flour, butter, milk, yeast, and sugar, with a filling consisting of sugar and cinnamon. However, raisins, chocolate, or pumpkin seeds may also be added. The dough is folded multiple times and glazed with butter, developing a sticky coating and rich flavor in the process. The name of this dish is possibly related to the French, who had occupied Hamburg during Napoleon's rule. Alternatively, it is said that a baker from Hamburg once cooked a Franzbrot (French bread) in butter, thus creating the Franzbrötchen. "
Rotkohl,"Rotkohl is a traditional salad and side dish made from red cabbage that is finely shredded and then braised or slow-cooked with ingredients like apples, onions, vinegar, sugar, and various spices such as cloves, bay leaves, and sometimes juniper berries. The dish is known for its sweet and sour flavor, which comes from the combination of sugar and vinegar, and its deep purple color, which can be enhanced by adding a bit of acidic liquid like apple cider vinegar or red wine during cooking. Rotkohl is often served as a side dish, particularly with hearty German meals such as roast pork, sausages, duck, or goose. It's especially popular in the colder months and is a common accompaniment to festive meals during Christmas. "
Knackwurst,"Knackwurst or knockwurst is a preboiled German sausage made from ground pork, beef, or a combination of both. The sausage is heavily seasoned with garlic and has a high fat content. Unlike bratwurst and other similar sausages, knackwurst's casing becomes extra crispy when heated, giving it a different texture and a specific sound when bitten into it. It is recommended to serve the sausage with sauerkraut, potato salad, pickles, mustard, and a glass of cold beer on the side."
Rindergulasch,"Rindsgoulasch is an Austrian and German take on the Hungarian goulash that is considered a staple of Viennese cuisine. It is typically prepared with beef, onions, garlic, powdered paprika, tomato paste, caraway seeds, marjoram, vinegar, salt, and pepper. And if done right, the meat should be tender and the gravy dark, smooth, and thick. Once all ingredients are sauteed, either water, stock, or red wine is added, and the goulash is cooked for hours until the meat is exceptionally tender. However, variations abound, and recipes usually differ in the number and type of spices used, the order in which the ingredients are added and sauteed, and the type of liquid used. Rindsgoulasch is typically served with potatoes, spätzle, various dumplings, and even homemade bread."
Kassler,"Kassler is a traditional Oktoberfest dish made with cured and smoked pork. The meat is usually smoked with alder or beechwood. When served, pork is almost always accompanied by sauerkraut and mashed or boiled potatoes on the side. The origin of the name is still unknown, although some claim that it was named after a Berlin-based butcher called Cassel in the 19th century."
Steckerlfisch,"Steckerlfisch (from steckerl, meaning a small pole or a stick in Bavarian) is a staple fish specialty in beer gardens and at folk fests and fairs throughout Germany, especially in the regions of Bavaria and Franconia. It consists of a whole fish that’s been gutted and cleaned, then threaded on a stick and grilled over hot embers. Although early versions typically used freshwater white fish and trout, the selection of fish expanded with time, and it nowadays includes saltwater fish too, with mackerel as the most prominent choice. The fish is typically either marinated or dusted with seasoned flour before cooking and once done, it is usually served in paper. This specialty is generally enjoyed with just a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, although it may sometimes be served brushed with olive oil and stuffed with thin lemon slices. When served on a plate, the grilled fish is typically accompanied by a fresh Bavarian pretzel or bretzen as it is called in Bavaria, and lemon wedges on the side. Considered the ultimate beer snack, steckerlfisch is the perfect accompaniment to a cold lager beer such as the German Augustiner. This fish dish is also a beloved specialty in Austria, and since it is a quintessential food item (and a firm favorite) at Oktoberfest, it is also commonly known as Oktoberfest fish on a stick."
Serviettenknoedel,"Serviettenknödel are German bread dumplings, or Semmelknödel that derive their name - napkin dumplings - from the way they are traditionally cooked: wrapped tightly and steamed inside a cloth napkin called serviette in German. They are typically made with pieces of stale bread rolls, baguettes, or pretzels, milk, eggs, lard, and softened onions. The bread mixture is usually seasoned with salt and pepper, and it is often enhanced with freshly chopped parsley and nutmeg for extra flavor. Once done, the log-shaped dumplings are generally cut into thick slices which can either be eaten as they are or pan-fried until nicely browned. These savory bread dumplings are a typical accompaniment to various roast meat delicacies, rouladen, gravy, mushroom sauces, and lentils, and they’ve been traditionally prepared for special occasions such as Christmas dinners and weddings. The dumplings are nowadays more commonly cooked in plastic wrap and aluminum foil instead of kitchen towels or napkins. Serviettenknödel have also been a part of other European cuisines, including Austrian and Czech cuisines."
Nuernberger Lebkuchen,"The history of Nuremberg's gingerbread is closely tied to the city's role as a crossroad of several European trade routes, a position that bestowed the city with spices from distant countries. Nürnberger Lebkuchen are typically large, round gingerbread wafers with icing that can either be chocolate-coated (schokoliert) or plain (natural). These gingerbread cookies are often decorated with almonds and candied lemon peel. Nürnberger Lebkuchen are produced by virtually all bakers in Nuremberg. They should contain at least 25% almonds, hazelnuts, or walnuts, and no more than 10% flour or starch, while the manufacturers must produce these cookies exclusively within the city limits of Nuremberg."
Mettwurst,"Mettwurst is a long and thin German sausage made with a combination of pork and beef, flavored with anything from garlic, pepper, marjoram, caraway, and mace to alcoholic beverages such as rum and cognac. The sausage is cured and cold smoked or air-dried. Mettwurst can be cooked and served with kale or cabbage, fried, or simply spread on bread and eaten as it is. There are also firmer variations of this sausage, which are often used in a variety of soups and stews."
Butterkuchen,"Butterkuchen is a simple cake that is mostly sold in bakeries and typically enjoyed with afternoon coffee. In some parts of Germany, it has become such an integral part of life that it’s served for special occasions such as weddings and funerals. Butter cake, as the name translates, is made with yeasted dough consisting of flour, sugar, butter, and milk. The dough is thinly rolled out in the shape of a rectangle, then poked in order to appear dimpled. Those little holes are filled with butter shavings or small butter cubes, and the entire cake is sprinkled with vanilla sugar and chopped almonds."
Mohnkuchen,"Mohnkuchen is a German term that encompasses a variety of desserts that are prepared with poppy seeds. Most commonly, it refers to various types of open-faced and streusel cakes that couple the creamy poppy filling with a shortcrust pastry and a crumbly topping, but it can also include different types of sponge or bundt cakes. Poppy seeds are often enriched with spices, citrus zest, or liquors, and the cakes are often complemented by fruit, marzipan, or sweetened cheese. Mohnkuchen cakes are popular throughout Germany and Austria and can be enjoyed on special occasions or as a simple afternoon dessert."
Mett,"Called hackepeter or mett, this unusual German specialty consists of raw pork mince which is meant to be eaten as it is - fresh and raw. The raw meat is typically seasoned with salt and pepper, though it is usually enhanced with crushed caraway, marjoram, nutmeg, and garlic for added flavor. When raw onions are added to the basic mett, the resulting concoction is called zwiebelmett, while the addition of onions and marjoram makes what is known as a thüringer mett. In Germany, seasoned raw pork mince is typically enjoyed slathered over bread rolls (mettbrötchen) or slices of bread, usually sprinkled with raw onion rings on top. Another common way of serving this delicacy is in the form of a mettigel (also known as hackepeterigel or hackepeterschwein), referring to the hedgehog-shaped presentation of mett which was popularized in the 1970s."
Frankfurter Wuerstchen,"As the name suggests, frankfurter würstchen is a variety of sausage hailing from Frankfurt, where it has been traditionally prepared for centuries. Lightly seasoned and slim, the sausage is made entirely with pork and is typically added into a natural sheep casing. Frankfurter würstchen is boiled and lightly smoked, a process which imparts a pleasant hint of smokiness to this German meat specialty. Since the sausage is pre-cooked, it is usually simply heated in simmering water before being enjoyed with accompaniments such as mustard, horseradish, bread, or potato salad, and it is often washed down with a glass of fine apple wine (Apfelwein). This particular sausage variety has enjoyed a protected status in Germany since 1860, when a law was passed permitting only those sausages made in Frankfurt and its surroundings to carry the name frankfurter, whereas other sausage varieties made outside this area, but in the same fashion, were supposed to be labeled as nach frankfurter art (frankfurter-style sausages). Frankfurter würstchen are always served in pairs."
Zimtsterne,"Zimtsterne are crispy star-shaped German and Austrian cookies. They are made with a combination of whipped egg whites that are mixed with sugar, cinnamon, ground nuts—traditionally almonds with the occasional addition of hazelnuts—and vanilla sugar. The dough is rolled and cut into star-shaped cookies. After baking, each cookie is coated with a layer of white frosting that is made from a combination of egg whites and sugar. The name of these cookies translates as cinnamon stars, due to the heavy use of the aromatic spice. Apart from Germany, Zimtsterne are also found in other German-speaking countries, and they are a staple treat during Advent and Christmas. It is not known when and where they originated, but their first written mention dates back to 1538. At the time, cinnamon was a rare and expensive ingredient, and it took approximately two hundred years for these cookies to become an integral recipe in various German cookbooks.  "
Donauwelle,"Donauwelle is a German and Austrian sheet cake. It consists of two pound cakes, one on the bottom, flavored with vanilla, and one on top of it, flavored with chocolate. Cherries, buttercream, and chocolate ganache are then added to the top, and as the cake bakes, the tart cherries will fall down through the batter, making a wavy pattern (maybe reminiscent of the Danube river?) in the cross-section of the cake. It's also known as Schneewittchenkuchen and Schneewittchentorte, which means Snow White cake, referring to the colors – black, white, and red."
Eierkuchen,"Eierkuchen are traditional German pancakes made by combining eggs, flour, milk, butter, baking powder, sugar, and salt. The batter is typically flavored with vanilla extract or cinnamon, although the sugar and other sweet flavorings may be omitted to make a savory version of these pancakes. A layer of batter is poured into melted butter or oil using a ladle, making sure the mixture covers the bottom of the pan forming a thin and round pancake. The pancakes are cooked on both sides until nicely browned, and they are then enjoyed while still warm, usually slathered with applesauce, fruit preserves, jams, or chocolate-hazelnut spreads. Also known as pfannkuchen, this simple treat is traditionally eaten for breakfast or as a sweet snack at any time of the day."
Nudelsuppe,"Nudelsuppe is a simple German noodle soup that typically consists of noodles in clear soup. Traditionally, the base for the soup is a rich chicken or beef broth with German soup vegetables or soup greens (Suppengrün) such as carrots, parsnips, leeks, celery, onions, and turnips. Thin egg noodles such as faddennudeln are the most commonly used noodles for this soup, although other noodle varieties may also be used instead of it. The soup and the noodles are usually prepared separately, and the boiled noodles are then added to the hot soup right before serving. Nudelsuppe is sometimes enhanced with pieces of diced or shredded chicken or beef, depending on the type of broth used for the base, and it's usually sprinkled with fresh chives or parsley on top. In Germany, noodle soups are typically enjoyed as a starter, and they have long been a part of the traditional Shabbat dinner."
Rote Gruetze,"Rote grütze (in Germany) or rødgrød (in Denmark) is a traditional dessert made mainly with redcurrants, which can be combined with other red summer berries such as raspberries, strawberries, blackcurrants, or blackberries. The fruit is mixed and cooked along with sugar and potato starch, hence its gelatinous consistency. Traditionally, the dish was made with cereals and was popular among the lower classes in the Middle Ages. Nowadays, semolina or sago are sometimes used in the preparation of this dessert. Rote grütze is served hot or cold, with milk, vanilla sauce, ice-cream, whipped-cream, or custard."
Dampfnudeln,"Dampfnudeln is a traditional dish made by steaming yeast dough dumplings in water, milk, and butter. After the liquids have evaporated, the dumplings are fried in butter until they develop a crispy crust on the bottom, while the top remains soft from the steaming process. Dampfnudeln can be prepared in a savory or sweet versions. The savory version is a Palatinate specialty, steamed in salt water, typically without a filling, and it is usually accompanied by a thick potato soup. The sweet versions are usually filled with fruit jams and accompanied by vanilla custard or fruit compotes. Although it is not known whether the first dampfnudel was made in Palatinate or Bavaria, the earliest written reference to the dumplings was found in an 1811 cookbook called The Bavarian Dampfnudeln."
Zwiebelrostbraten,"Zwiebelrostbraten is a traditional dish that's served in most German and Austrian restaurants in Bavaria and Vienna, respectively. The dish is usually made with a combination of beef (sirloin steak), onions, flour, oil, butter, paprika, Dijon mustard, cream, beef stock, salt, and pepper. The onions are sliced into rings, dipped in a mixture of flour and paprika, fried in oil, and set aside. The steaks are lightly pounded, seasoned with salt and pepper, coated with flour and paprika, fried in oil and butter on both sides, and removed from the pan. The fried onions are returned to the pan with mustard and beef stock, and the mixture is cooked until the juice are reduced. Cream is added to the pan and everything is simmered for a few minutes. The steaks are added to the sauce, and the dish is then served with spätzle or potatoes on the side. The meat is typically topped with the remaining onions before serving."
Schwaebische Maultaschen,"Originating from Swabia in eastern Baden-Württemberg, Schwäbische Maultaschen are traditional, savory dumplings filled with ground meat, onions, spinach, and bread. This hearty dish is ideal for cold winter months and can be prepared in three ways: sliced and fried with eggs, simmered in broth, or topped with onions and butter. Originally, the dish was invented by Cistercian monks from the Maulbronn Monastery in the 1600s. Since meat was forbidden during Lent, the monks chopped the meat and combined it with spinach and herbs to hide it, while the dough was used as another layer of disguise for the meat. Today, the dish is so popular that there is an annual Maultaschen Festival held every autumn in Freiberg am Neckar."
Wurstsalat,"   Wurstsalat is a traditional salad from Germany (especially southern parts), Switzerland, Austria, and Alsace in France made with strips of sausage. It's a popular dish often consumed as a light meal in beer gardens or traditional inns, especially during the warm summer months. The main ingredient in wurstsalat is thinly sliced sausage. The most commonly used type is Lyoner, fleischwurst, or stadtwurst, although the Swiss variant often uses cervelat. These are all types of cooked sausage that are similar to bologna or frankfurter. The sliced sausage is mixed with chopped onions, and the salad is dressed with a simple vinaigrette made from oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. The dish is typically marinated for a few hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld together. There are several regional variations of Wurstsalat. For example, in Switzerland and in the Swabian and Bavarian regions of Germany, it's common to add pickles and cheese, typically Swiss Emmental, to the salad. In some regions, it's also common to add other ingredients such as radishes, boiled eggs, tomatoes, or bell peppers. Wurstsalat is typically served chilled, often accompanied by bread or pretzels. It can be a standalone dish or part of a larger meal. Despite its simplicity, wurstsalat is beloved for its tangy, hearty flavors and refreshing qualities.   "
Braunschweiger,"Braunschweiger is a German dish using liverwurst sausage as the main ingredient. The sausage is first sliced into smaller pieces, then combined with smoked meat (such as bacon) in a pan. The two are fried together until they develop a nice, browned color. Braunschweiger is typically served as a main meal, and it is often accompanied by mashed potatoes, vegetables, or pasta."
Pellkartoffeln,"Pellkartoffeln refers to boiled or steamed potatoes with their skins intact. This traditional German dish can be enjoyed on its own or served as an accompaniment to a variety of different dishes. The potatoes are usually scrubbed to remove any impurities and then cooked whole in water seasoned with salt and (sometimes) caraway seeds or bay leaves. Leaving the skin intact allows the potatoes to cook better and retain more of their natural flavor and nutrients. Once done, the potatoes can either be peeled or eaten with their skins intact. The simplest way to enjoy pellkartoffeln is with salt and butter, although another popular way is to accompany them with kräuterquark (quark mixed with fresh herbs). Other typical combinations include pellkartofflen with salmon remoulade (Lachsremoulade), quark and flaxseed oil, leberwurst, heringsalat, or curry sauce. Pellkartoffeln are also used to prepare other potato-based specialties such as the ubiquitous German potato salad (Kartoffelsalat), roasted potatoes, pan-fried potatoes (Bratkartoffeln), various potato dumplings (Kartoffelklöße), a type of potato-based pasta (Schupfnudeln), potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer), mashed potatoes (Kartoffelpüree), and potato soups."
Apfelmus,"Different versions of apple sauces have been prepared since ancient times—a combination of pork and apples is even mentioned in Apicius, a collection of Roman cookery recipes, while different medieval varieties appear in English as well as various Central and Northern European cookbooks. Apple sauce is made with cored apples that are cooked until they are soft enough to be mashed in a purée. Other ingredients typically include sugar and spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Unlike apple butter, the sauce is lighter in color and has a more liquid consistency. Although it is subtly sweet and it is often used as a topping on desserts, apple sauce is also a great accompaniment to roasted meat dishes, especially pork, duck, or goose. It is difficult to say when and where applesauce originated, but it is believed that it appeared out of necessity to preserve fruit during winter. The origin of applesauce is often associated with Central Europe, but the first written mention is found in an English cookbook Compleat Housewife, written by Eliza Smith in 1739. The sauce is also commonly prepared in the United States. "
Pfeffernuss,"Pfeffernuss is a spiced German Christmas cookie. Although there is no set recipe and the variations appear throughout the country, the dough is usually heavily spiced with several spices. The list typically includes white pepper, which gives the cookie its name, cinnamon, cardamom, anise, cloves, allspice, ground ginger, and nutmeg. Sometimes, they are made with a gingerbread spice blend known as lebkuchengewürz, while some variations also use orange or lemon zest. These cookies are a Christmas staple, mostly prepared and enjoyed throughout the Christmas period. They are typically round and often dusted in sugar or covered in icing glaze. They share many similarities with Danish (pebernødder) and Dutch (pepernoten) pepper cookies."
Rollmops,"Rollmops is a German dish consisting of pickled herring fillets that are wrapped around ingredients such as gherkins, onion rings, or green olives. The combination is then usually skewered with a cocktail skewer. The dish is traditionally eaten cold, on its own or with bread. It grew in popularity in 19th-century Berlin, and it was a common pub food in the city. Aside from Germany, rollmops are also popular in England and Poland, especially during the Christmas season."
Griessbrei,"Grießbrei is a traditional Central European pudding based on semolina. The dish is made with milk, semolina, and sugar. It's often flavored with vanilla and cinnamon. The milk is heated, the semolina stirred in, and the mixture is then stirred until it becomes creamy and thick. Most people like to eat semolina pudding for breakfast, and the dish is sometimes enhanced with the addition of fruit such as cherries, strawberries, peaches, pears, or apples. It's recommended to serve it in a shallow bowl since there's more surface area to cover with the desired toppings. The dish is prepared in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic."
Engelsaugen,"These delicious thumbprint cookies are an absolute must for Christmas in Germany. They are traditionally made with a simple shortcrust base that is filled with red currant jam. Interestingly, in some parts of Germany, engelsaugen (angel eyes) are called husarenkrapfen, which translates as Hussars' donuts."
Rahmschnitzel,"Rahmschnitzel is a German meat dish. It's usually prepared with a veal cutlet, but pork or chicken can be used instead, if preferred. Other ingredients include flour, butter, white wine, heavy cream, and herbs such as parsley and chives. The meat is tenderized and seasoned, then rolled in flour and fried in butter until golden brown. White wine is added to the pan in order to form a sauce with heavy cream and a bit of sugar. When done, each cutlet is topped with the gravy and garnished with chopped chives or parsley. Traditionally, this dish is served with spaetzle, but pasta or potatoes are also welcome additions regarding side dishes."
Gruenkohl,"Grünkohl, meaning kale, refers to a variety of German dishes that have kale as their main ingredient. This leafy vegetable is widely used in traditional fall and winter specialties in the country, and it is usually blanched in hot water before it's cooked with other ingredients. Both fresh and frozen kale leaves can be used, although it is believed that frozen kale has a somewhat sweeter flavor than the fresh one. Grünkohl dishes typically feature some type of meat, and they are often enjoyed with potatoes, dumplings, and beer or other alcoholic beverages on the side. Kale is a highly versatile vegetable and there are endless ways to cook it, including grünkohl mit pinkel (kale with pinkel sausages) and grünkohl mit mettwurst (kale with raw minced pork sausages), which are two popular German kale specialties. In Germany, kale is commonly prepared on festive occasions such as Adventszeit (Advent Season) and Weihnachten (Christmas). Numerous dishes featuring this vegetable are often served at Christmas markets throughout Germany."
Himmel und Erde,"Himmel und Erde is a traditional dish originating as far back as the 18th century. Literally translated, the name of the dish means Heaven and Earth, derived from the old word for potatoes – Erdapfel. The dish consists of mashed potatoes that are paired with apple sauce. It is most commonly served with meat dishes, while purists insist on having a blood sausage on the side. In that case, the dish is sometimes referred to as Himmel, Erde, und Höllen (Heaven, Earth, and Hell). Today, there are numerous variations on the original recipe depending on the region, but the classic version is still the most popular in Rhineland, its place of origin."
Mettbroetchen,"Mettbrötchen is a type of sandwich consisting of a fresh brötchen (a German bread roll) and mett (raw pork mince). The bread roll is sliced, then topped with a layer of mett, which is usually seasoned with salt and pepper and garnished with slices of raw onions on top. This sandwich is a typical breakfast item in Germany, and it is typically enjoyed in northern parts of the country. Interestingly, Mettwoch is a German custom of savoring mettbrötchen on Mittwoch (Wednesday)."
Koenigsberger Klopse,"Königsberger Klopse is a savory meal consisting of meatballs in a white sauce served with a side of boiled potatoes and sliced pickled beets. Similar dishes have existed since the Middle Ages, but klopse (lit. meatballs) were invented in Königsberg (now known as Kaliningrad) back in the 18th century. These meatballs are mostly made with minced veal and a small amount of either anchovies, sardines, or herrings, which are nicely contrasted by capers in the white sauce."
Kohlroulade,"Kohlroulade is a German version of stuffed cabbage rolls, consisting of blanched cabbage leaves that are tightly rolled around a filling of ground meat, breadcrumbs, eggs, onions, and a variety of spices. After assembling the cabbage rolls, they are first lightly browned before being simmered in meat broth until fully cooked and tender. Caraway, mustard, or tomato sauce can optionally be added to the sauce or the meat mixture for extra flavor. These stuffed cabbage rolls are typically enjoyed with a side of potatoes, cucumber salad, and a glass of beer. In Germany, kohlroulade is commonly prepared during winter, and it can be made with different types of meat including beef, pork, turkey, or chicken."
Bayerische Breze,"This traditional Bavarian pretzel is shaped to symbolize two arms folded for prayer, and they are available in different versions and sizes, usually topped with a sprinkling with coarse salt. Their crust is thin, dark brown, shiny, and has a cracked surface after baking. The dough, however, is juicy, tender, and light in color. As opposed to Swabian pretzels, Bavarian pretzels are thicker and not sliced lengthwise in the middle. Local differences can be recognized by their various forms. The Bavarian pretzel is a vital part of Bavarian snack culture, and it is especially delicious when buttered or paired with cheese. It is an indispensable accompaniment to Munich white sausage and Bavarian meatloaf."
Gefilte Fish,"Gefilte fish, or stuffed fish (from gefilte, which means filled or stuffed in Yiddish), is a ubiquitous Jewish appetizer that is based on chopped or ground fish. This dish is typically prepared with ground carp, pike, or whitefish that is combined with a variety of other ingredients before it is shaped into balls or oval patties, which are then usually simmered in fish stock. Typical ingredients that go into gefilte fish include matzo meal, eggs, onions, carrots, leeks, parsley, goose fat or oil, and various seasonings and spices such as salt, pepper, allspice, sugar, cinnamon, or bay leaves. Gefilte fish may be more on the savory side, with a distinctive peppery flavor, as it is usually prepared in countries such as Lithuania and Russia, or sweet, a version that is typical of Polish cuisine. Believed to date back to medieval Germany, this specialty has been attributed to the Ashkenazi Jews, and despite the many different theories regarding its creation, the dish has most likely been invented out of poverty and the need to feed many people with as little expense as possible. Today, gefilte fish balls or patties are available in jarred or frozen versions, though many people prefer the homemade versions over the store-bought ones as these are almost always rather bland-tasting and unappetizing. The dish is usually enjoyed chilled or at room temperature, topped with boiled carrots and onions, and accompanied by a side of chrain (ground horseradish, often mixed with beets). Gefilte fish has been traditionally consumed for Shabbat, although it is also eaten for a number of Jewish holidays such as Passover Seder and Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year."
Schwenkbraten,"A barbecue specialty hailing from Saarland, schwenkbraten consists of marinated pork steaks that are grilled on a schwenker, a unique grill which is suspended from a tripod and swung over an open wood fire by a schwenkmeister (the person doing the grilling). The pork steaks used in the dish are typically neck cuts, but other pork cuts will also do. They are usually left to soak in the marinating mixture overnight or up to 3 days. Typical ingredients used in the marinade include dried thyme, dried oregano, onions, salt, black pepper, garlic, juniper berries, oil, and (optionally) German Riesling wine. With a crispy crust on the outside and succulent and tender meat on the inside, these grilled pork steaks are typically paired with a glass of fine German Riesling or beer, along with various side dishes such as potato salads, fresh salads, roasted vegetables, and bread rolls."
Toast Hawaii,"Although its ingredients aren't exactly traditionally German, toast Hawaii is a modern German classic - it was popularized by a TV cook Clemens Wilmenrod in the 1950s. In a similar way that the Americans have ruined pizza for some (mostly Italians) by adding pineapple to it, the Germans have also done the same thing to a sandwich. Toast Hawaii is an open-faced sandwich consisting of a buttered slice of toasted white bread that's topped with a slice of ham, a slice of pineapple, and a slice of Gouda or Swiss cheese. The sandwich is placed under the broiler until the cheese melts, and the hole in the middle is then garnished with a cocktail cherry. The ingredients used in this sandwich are a result of the time when it was invented – due to the fact that almost every household had canned pineapple and cheese slices at the time, it made this easily prepared sandwich seem exotic or even upscale. Shortly after its invention, toast Hawaii started to appear on West German restaurant menus, usually accompanied by a bottle of Worcestershire sauce on the side."
Strammer Max,"Strammer Max is a German open-faced sandwich that's served warm and has numerous variations. It's usually made with a slice of rye or wheat flour bread that can be toasted and buttered or fried in oil or butter. The bread is seasoned with salt, pepper, and (sometimes) mustard. It is then topped with slices of cured ham and a fried egg to finish it off. Due to the fact that it's quick and easy to prepare the sandwich, it spread throughout the country, but it's especially popular in Berlin, where it's an integral part of the city's food culture. Nowadays it can be found anywhere from street food stands and pubs to upscale restaurants. The most popular variations include Stramme Lotte, made with cooked ham, and Strammer Otto, with slices of salami or beef. In Bavaria, the sandwich is made with a slice of leberkäse, while a ladle of goulash as the topping is a specialty of Cologne."
Schneckenkuchen,"The name of this sweet German bread that translates as snail cake was inspired by its shape since it consists of numerous rolls neatly placed in a pan, whose final shape is reminiscent of snail shells. The base of the bread is prepared with a brioche-like dough that is shaped into rolls. Each roll usually consists of various fillings such as vanilla-flavored custard, cinnamon butter, fruit, raisins, poppy seeds, or marzipan. When baked, the bread is glazed or dusted with powdered sugar. In Alsace, the dish is better known as chinois."
Thueringer Rostbratwurst,"Thüringer Rostbratwurst is a product with centuries of tradition. The oldest known recipe, held at the Weimar State Archives, dates back to 1613. Martin Luther and Goethe both appreciated it, and it was often praised in literature. Only finely minced pork (sometimes mixed with beef or veal) is used to make this sausage, and the spice mixtures that are added vary depending on the recipes and regional characteristics. These sausages are easily distinguished from other German sausages by their low fat content and a distinctive combination of spices and seasonings – salt, pepper, caraway, marjoram, and garlic. Due to its unique and delicious flavor, Thüringer Rostbratwurst is still very popular in Germany and beyond, and it can be found at most sausage stands in Thuringia."
Muenchner Schnitzel,"Münchner schnitzel is an interesting variety on the world-famous Wiener schnitzel. This is a Munich-style variety, hence the name of the dish. The veal cutlets are brushed with a combination of sweet mustard and horseradish before they're coated in flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs, then fried in butter. The dish is ready to be eaten when the meat becomes golden brown. It's traditionally served hot with lemon wedges on the side."
Labskaus,"Labskaus is a dish from northern Germany consisting of corned beef, mashed potatoes, and beets, with additional ingredients such as fried eggs, pickles, and rollmops—a pickled, rolled herring. Although its origins are somewhat murky, the dish was most probably invented in the 16th century, when it was typically eaten by poor people, sailors, and seamen, due to the fact that pickled and canned foods were inexpensive and could last during long travels. Although the dish is particularly popular in the cities of Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck, variations of labskaus are prepared and consumed throughout northern Europe."
Saumagen,"Saumagen is a German dish from the region of Palatinate, where it was created in the 18th century by local farmers as a way to use up leftover food. Translated as sow’s stomach, saumagen consists of potatoes, carrots, onions, and pork that have been seasoned and stuffed in a thick casing (pig's stomach) which is also intended to be a part of the meal. Typical spices include marjoram, nutmeg, and white pepper. Once cooked, saumagen can be served as it is with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut on the side, but it can also be sliced and additionally fried. What makes the dish even better is a glass of dry white wine or a cold beer on the side."
Aachener Printen,"This is a special variety of brown, firm gingerbread that has been baked in Aachen since the 1820s. The term printe refers to the use of carved wooden molds into which the dough is pressed during production. Having been regionally protected, the Aachener Printen may only be produced in Aachen and a few neighboring villages. The dough is made from flour, sugar, and exotic spices such as cinnamon, aniseed, or ginger, which impart a unique flavor to the gingerbread. Freshly baked Printen are always firm, but because many people prefer their pastries tender, they are also offered in a soft version. Experts swear that Printen taste the best if they are left for a few days to develop their full flavor."
Topfenstrudel,"Austrian cuisine prides in their old traditional pastry desserts, and the delicate strudels are surely the most popular variety. Even though it is not as famous as the apple filled version, topfenstrudel is regarded as one of Austria’s favorites. Made with soft, mildly sweetened quark cheese which is folded with the elastic and almost see-through dough or puff pastry, the strudel is baked until a crispy golden crust is formed on top. Raisins, apricots, and peaches are occasionally added to the quark cheese mixture, which is gently spiced with vanilla or lemon. Even though they are most commonly associated with Austria, topfenstrudel, and all other strudel varieties, are eaten throughout the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Their origins are believed to be in the Ottoman Empire, whose culinary influence spread across the Balkans, and Hungary, before finally reaching Vienna. The topfenstrudel can be found everywhere in Austria, served in both traditional and modern restaurants, as well as in classic Austrian patisseries. Commonly, a slice of warm topfenstrudel is paired with a sweet vanilla sauce or fresh fruit on the side."
Thueringer Kloesse,"A quintessential specialty hailing from Thuringia, Thüringer klöße is a simple potato dumpling that consists of a mixture of grated raw potatoes and mashed cooked potatoes filled with crunchy cubes of bread. The dumplings are typically cooked in simmering water, but they can also be lightly browned in butter for extra flavor. These traditional Thuringian potato dumplings are a great accompaniment to a variety of German meat delicacies, and they are often served with dishes such as meat roulades, roasted meat, stuffed cabbage rolls, red cabbage, or sauerkraut. Large and perfectly rounded, these German potato dumplings used to be prepared on Sundays and were once considered to be food for the poor. In Heichelheim, there is a Thuringian Dumpling Museum (Thüringer Kloßmuseum) that honors these dumplings. Nowadays, Thüringer klöße are a staple of numerous traditional restaurants in the region."
Knipp,"Knipp is a German sausage that is believed to have originated in Bremen. It is made with pork or beef, oats, onions, allspice, salt, pepper, and various herbs. Although knipp is visually unappealing, when fried in butter and served on a slice of toasted white bread or wholemeal bread, it makes for a great breakfast treat. Originally, it was consumed by peat diggers who used to mix ground offal and bacon rind with oatmeal. It is recommended to serve knipp with pickles, applesauce, or fried potatoes on the side."
Schneeballen,"This German specialty consists of thin strips of shortcrust pastry that are loosely intertwined and wrapped into balls which are deep-fried until golden and crispy. Traditional versions are dusted with sugar, but there are also variations may be covered in chocolate glaze or different combinations of nuts, coconut, cinnamon, or marzipan. Schneeballen, which translates as snowballs, are traditionally associated with Rothenberg ob der Tauber, but they can be found throughout Bavaria. Although they were once enjoyed only on special occasions, nowadays they are a staple at numerous Bavarian pastry shops."
Frankfurter Gruene Sosse,"Frankfurter Grüne Soße is a famous cold herb sauce from Frankfurt, consisting of sour cream, spices, and herbs. Traditionally, there should be seven herbs in the sauce, and 70% of them should have been grown in Frankfurt. These seven herbs are borage, chervil, garden cress, parsley, salad burnet, sorrel, and chives. The sauce is so well-known that there is even a Grüne Soße monument in Frankfurt-Oberrad. The monument consists of seven greenhouses, each one representing a different herb used in the sauce. It is still unknown whether the French immigrants or Italian traders brought the recipe to Frankfurt, since green sauces were known for centuries in those countries. There's also a very popular myth about the green sauce being Goethe's favorite dish, and according to it, it was invented by his mother. Although there is no evidence for the popular myth, it is a fact that the first recipe for the sauce was found in an 1860 cookbook written by Wilhelmine Rührig. Today, the sauce is commonly served with boiled eggs and potatoes, fish, or Tafelspitz."
Springerle,"Also known as little jumper or little knight, springerle is an anise-flavored biscuit made from wheat flour, eggs, and powdered sugar. In the past, the dough used to be leavened with hartshorn salt, but modern day recipes typically use baking powder. The designs and images on top are made with flat molds, presses, and boards, or specially crafted wooden rolling pins. The origin of these biscuits can be traced back to southwestern Germany and the 14th century. The oldest mold for springerle comes from Switzerland, and it was also made in the 14th century."
Bethmaennchen,"Bethmännchen have been a Christmas staple in Germany for over 200 years. Hailing from Frankfurt, these cookies are made from marzipan dough that is infused with rose water. Before they are glazed and baked, each cookie is decorated with three almond halves. Bethmännchen are closely associated with the once influential Bethmann family. The legend says that the family’s pastry chef, who was inspired by a similar dessert known as Frankfurter Brenten, invented the cookies in 1838 and decorated them to honor Bethmann's four sons. Although disputed, it is said that one of the almonds was subsequently removed after one of the sons passed away. The cookies are now popular across the country, but Bethmännchen are still strongly linked with Frankfurt, and they are usually prepared during the festive Christmas season."
Hirschgulasch,"Hirschgulasch is a traditional type of goulash, a stew of meat, vegetables, and spices made specifically with venison, or deer meat, instead of the beef or pork that might be used in other types of goulash. The name of the dish translates to venison goulash. The venison is typically cut into small, bite-sized pieces and then slow-cooked with various ingredients like onions, garlic, tomatoes, and a variety of spices. Other ingredients can also be included, such as red wine, bay leaves, juniper berries, and herbs, all of which enhance the flavor of the dish. The result is a rich, hearty stew with a robust flavor. "
Griebenschmalz,"Griebenschmalz is a traditional spread that consists of rendered pork fat (schmalz) and cracklings (grieben). The crunchiness of the pork cracklings perfectly complements the smooth and creamy texture of the lard, and the spread is often flavored with apples, onions, and spices such as marjoram, thyme, bay leaves, allspice, salt, and pepper. Griebenschmalz is typically spread on a slice of sourdough or rye bread or atop a pretzel bun. It is often topped with caramelized onions and served with pickled gherkins and a glass of beer on the side. Usually associated with the region of Bavaria, this German specialty is commonly available in beer pubs, beer gardens, and numerous traditional restaurants in the country."
Dresdner Stollen,"Dresdner stollen is an aromatic German fruit bread that has been closely associated with Christmas. It consists of buttery yeast dough that is spiced and usually studded with candied orange, lemon peel, sultanas, sweet and bitter almonds, and lemon zest. It is formed in large loafs, and when baked, the bread is brushed with butter and generously dusted with powdered sugar. Originally referred to as striezel, it is believed that the first stollen was not as rich as today’s versions, following the tradition of fasting during Advent. In 1490, the Pope Innocent VIII lifted the ban on baking with butter during Advent for Dresden bakers, allowing them to create more elaborate stollen versions. Because of its long history and cultural significance, this German classic has been awarded the Protected Geographical Indication status by the European Commission in 2010, which restricts the production of Dresdner stollen to the state capital Dresden and twelve municipalities in the greater Dresden area."
Leberkaessemmel,"This classic Bavarian and Austrian sandwich consists of a thick slice of leberkäse—a product consisting of ground meat that is baked into a meatloaf—which is served inside a halved bread roll (semmel). Typically, the sandwich will also include a generous slather of sweet mustard. In Bavaria, leberkässemmel is usually served in beer gardens, while the Austrian version is typically prepared and sold at street kiosks."
Rinderbrust,"In the American, English and German systems of primal beef cuts, the brisket (or rinderbrust) is a cut that comes from the breast or lower chest of the cow. The brisket is one of the nine primal cuts of beef and is particularly known for its size and for having a significant amount of connective tissue. This cut consists of two different muscles: the pectoralis major, known as the ""flat,"" and the pectoralis minor, or the ""point."" The flat is leaner, while the point has more fat and marbling. Because of the high amount of connective tissue, brisket needs to be cooked slowly, over low heat, to allow the collagen in the meat to break down and become tender. This makes it a popular choice for slow cooking methods like smoking, braising, or slow roasting. Brisket is notably used in a variety of regional American barbecue traditions, particularly Texas-style barbecue, where it's often smoked for many hours. It's also traditionally used for making corned beef and pastrami."
Filet,"In the American, French, German, Brazilian, and Korean systems of primal beef cuts, the tenderloin is a cut from the loin, which is located towards the back of the cow, nestled under the ribs, next to the backbone. It spans two primal cuts: the short loin and the sirloin. The tenderloin is one of the most tender cuts of beef as it comes from a muscle that doesn't get much exercise. It is also one of the most highly prized and correspondingly expensive cuts of beef, due to its tenderness and flavor. Given the tenderness of this cut, the tenderloin is often cooked quickly over high heat, with methods such as grilling or broiling. It's often served slightly rare to maintain its tender texture. "
Zigeunerschnitzel,"Zigeunerschnitzel is a German specialty consisting of a thin, breaded, and pan-fried veal cutlet (but pork, or chicken can also be used) that is finished with a spicy sauce on top just before serving. This schnitzel was named after the sauce it is topped with, which is called zigeuner sauce or gypsy sauce and is typically made with a combination of bell peppers of different colors, onions, tomato paste or tomatoes, mushrooms, wine, water, broth, and spices such as sweet and hot paprika. In Germany, the dish is not a common home-cooked meal but a typical food item that can be enjoyed at restaurants, cafeterias, and food stalls. Zigeunerschnitzel is usually accompanied by sides such as french fries, salzkartoffeln (salt potatoes), and salads, but it also pairs well with rice or spätzle. The name of this dish has been deemed offensive and politically incorrect toward the Romani people, which has led to a ban of its use in some parts of Germany and the rise of alternative names for this schnitzel such as balkanschnitzel or paprikaschnitzel."
Berliner Pfannkuchen,"Krapfen was probably the first European-style doughnut to appear, followed by similar varieties in other countries. These pastries are traditionally prepared with leavened dough that is deep-fried until golden and crispy on the outside, while they remain soft, light, and airy on the inside. Though krapfen can be prepared plain, they are most often filled or topped with jams, and vanilla or chocolate custards, while the top is usually dusted with powdered sugar or drizzled with chocolate. The origin of the word krapfen dates back to 9th century, and the recipes in German can be found as early as the 14th century. The sweet versions of the pastry became predominant, and have remained closely associated with the Carnival, a festive period which precedes Christian Lent. Interestingly, during the Carnival, one krapfen in a batch filled with jam and fruit preserves might contain a filling of mustard as a prank. It is believed that doughnuts spread throughout many central European countries, which adopted the technique but used different regional names. Consequently, krapfen in Germany goes under Berliner, pfannkuchen, faschingskrapfen, krebbel, or kreppel. In Poland, they are known as pączki or krepel, Hungarians refer to them as fánk, Slovak as šišky, while the Czechs use the term koblihy. In Slovenia, they are better known as krofi, while the standard name throughout Croatia, Bosnia, and Serbia is krofne or krafne. In St. Petersburg, Russia, the doughnuts are known as pyshki (either ring-shaped or without a hole), and there is a local café that has been serving pyshki prepared from the original recipe since the 1960s."
Dinnete,"Dinnete is a traditional dish originating from Baden-Württemberg. This pizza-like dish is topped with sour cream, salt, pepper, eggs, onions, ham, and cheese such as Emmental. The dough is made with a combination of wheat flour, spelt flour, yeast, salt, and water, and it's rolled into an oval shape, thick or thin, depending on personal preferences. Once baked, the dinnete is usually sliced into big rectangles and served hot. Although onions, ham, and cheese are the most authentic combination, some people also like to add sliced potatoes to the topping. It's recommended to pair dinnete with a glass of young white wine on the side. The dish is especially popular in autumn and winter."
Bauernfruehstueck,"Bauernfrühstück is a traditional dish that can be translated as a farmer’s breakfast. Although there are many variations throughout the country, it’s usually made with a combination of potatoes, butter or vegetable oil, onions, cured ham, eggs, milk, chives, salt, and pepper. The potatoes are boiled in their skins, peeled, cut into slices, and browned in butter with the onions and diced ham. The eggs are beaten, mixed with milk, seasoned with salt and pepper, and the mixture is then cooked in the pan with the rest of the ingredients. Once fully cooked but still moist, the dish is garnished with chopped chives and served warm."
Rostbraten,"The term rostbraten is used in German-speaking countries, including Germany and Austria, to refer to certain cuts of beef as well as dishes made from these cuts. Regarding cuts, the rostbraten usually refers to a section from the rump or loin of the cow, which corresponds to parts of the sirloin or rump steak in the UK and the US. This cut is known for being lean and quite tender, making it well-suited to various cooking methods, including roasting, grilling, or pan-frying. When used in a dish also called rostbraten, this cut of beef is often seared in a hot pan and then further cooked in the oven or simmered with onions and broth, depending on regional variations of the recipe. "
Pichelsteiner,"Pichelsteiner is a thick German stew made with several kinds of meat and vegetables. Pork, beef, and mutton are the main ingredients alongside potatoes, carrots, cabbage, and leeks. Various other vegetables can be added for extra flavor, such as onions, celery, and garlic. The stew is seasoned with salt and pepper, then sprinkled with fresh parsley. Pichelsteiner is considered an all-time classic in Bavaria, where the dish originated from in the 19th century. Auguste Winkler, an innkeeper from the small village of Grattersdorf, is credited with inventing the stew at an open-air cooking festival in 1879. The first mention of this dish appeared in a German cookbook from 1894. Since then, Pichelsteiner became associated with open-air cooking festivals in Germany. It is traditionally served piping hot on cold and rainy days."
Leipziger Allerlei,"As the name suggests, this German specialty hails from Leipzig, and it is typically based on a mix of vegetables. The dish usually consists of a combination of young vegetables, crayfish tails, morel mushrooms, and bread dumplings which are doused in a creamy, buttery sauce. Typical vegetables used in the preparation of this regional dish include carrots, asparagus, kohlrabi, cauliflower, and peas. Leipziger allerlei is traditionally enjoyed in May and June, either as a main course or a side, and it is often sprinkled with freshly chopped parsley or chervil on top. It is believed that this humble dish originated in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars as a protective measure against thieves, beggars, and tax collectors, when the citizens were asked to offer only vegetable-based dishes in order to create a false image of impoverishment."
Flaedlesuppe,"Flädlesuppe or frittatensuppe (as it is known in Austria) is a traditional and Austrian soup that consists of a rich broth with thin strips of flädle (frittaten) pancakes, hence the name of the soup. Although the traditional version calls for beef broth as the base, chicken or vegetable stock may be used as well. The soup is often enhanced with chunks of steamed or sautéed vegetables such as leeks, carrots, celery, and green onions. After assembling the sliced and rolled strips in each serving bowl, this piping hot soup is poured over them and the whole thing is finished with a handful of freshly chopped herbs such as parsley, chives, or celery leaves on top."
Anisplaezchen,"Anispläzchen are traditional German Christmas cookies. As the name suggests, the cookies are flavored with aniseed, and may optionally incorporate cinnamon. Although other ingredients include only eggs, sugar, and flour, the unique technique in which the batter is left to partially dry before baking gives these cookies a light and crispy top layer while the center remains chewy and moist. The cookies are usually baked and enjoyed for Christmas."
Gelbwurst,"Hailing from Bavaria, gelbwurst or yellow sausage is a German sausage variety that has been traditionally stuffed into natural casings dyed with saffron, hence the name. The sausage may consist of pork, veal or beef, bacon, or chicken, and it is typically flavored with various spices such as nutmeg, mace, pepper, ginger, cardamom, and lemon, depending on the region. Gelbwurst is distinguished by a pale grey color, a mild flavor, and a very smooth texture due to the practice of finely grinding the seasoned meat mixture. This traditional sausage is nowadays usually found inside artificial casings of yellow or orange color. Belonging to the group of cooked sausages, the sausage can be thinly sliced or cut into thick slices and fried. Either way, the slices are typically enjoyed with fresh bread for breakfast or dinner. Gelbwurst dates back to 1905, when the original version was prepared with the addition of pork brains, resulting in regional variations on the name such as hirnwurst, meaning brain sausage."
Lyoner Wurst,"Lyoner wurst is a parboiled German sausage that consists of pork, bacon, garlic, and a variety of spices, although beef is sometimes also added to the combination. After the parboiling process, the sausage is hot-smoked, and both of its ends are tied with a string to give it the shape of a horseshoe ring. The sausage gets its name from the French city of Lyon, which is believed to have been the home of this meat specialty. Lyoner wurst is often referred to as German bologna or garlicky bologna outside of Germany, whereas another common name used for this sausage variety in the country is fleischwurst. The sausage can be enjoyed both chilled and warm, and it is typically eaten with dark bread or crusty bread rolls and a generous smear of mustard over it. Strips of Lyoner wurst are often combined with raw onion rings and pickles drenched in vinaigrette to create a traditional German wurstsalat (lit. sausage salad)."
Frankfurter Schnitzel,"Frankfurter schnitzel is a traditional dish originating from Frankfurt. The dish is very similar to the famous Wiener schnitzel, which is always made with veal, but this version from Frankfurt can be prepared with other types of meat such as pork. The meat is pounded thin, coated with flour, dipped in beaten eggs, and dredged in breadcrumbs before it's fried in clarified butter (or a mixture of oil and butter) on both sides until golden brown and crispy. Once done, frankfurter schnitzel is traditionally served with grüne soße (green sauce), and often boiled potatoes and chopped hard-boiled eggs on the side. It's recommended to squeeze some lemon juice over the schnitzel before eating, while Apfelwein is the preferred accompanying beverage."
Matzeknoedelsuppe,"The center of every Jewish Seder—Passover meal—is a bowl of chicken broth with large matzah balls. The dish is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, and it is believed that it originated among the Ashkenazi Jews who invented it as an adaptation of Central European bread dumplings (knödels). In Jewish tradition, the large balls are often referred to as kneydl, knaidel, kneidel, or knodel and are made with matzo meal—consisting of ground matzo bread—and rendered chicken fat. Nowadays, matzah ball soup is not exclusively associated with Passover and has become a year-round comfort food that is enjoyed in most Jewish communities."
Hochzeitssuppe,"Originating from Germany, hochzeitssuppe is a traditional wedding soup that derives its name from the German words hochzeit, meaning wedding, and suppe, which means soup. Similar to the Italian-American version of wedding soup called minestra maritata (lit. married soup), this version is also based on clear meat broth and it typically contains either chunks of chicken or small meatballs, white asparagus spears, egg noodles, and egg custard. The soup varies from one region to another, with some variations calling for the addition of currants or raisins for extra flavor, or enhancing the broth with a variety of vegetables such as carrots, leeks, onions, celeriac, cauliflowers, or green peas. A popular variation of the soup that is typical of Westphalia uses beef and beef broth instead of chicken and chicken broth, and it is commonly referred to as westfälische hochzeitssuppe (Westphalian wedding soup). Hochzeitssuppe is a traditional first course at German wedding receptions, and it is usually served piping hot, garnished with freshly chopped herbs such as parsley or chives."
Ofenschlupfer,"This traditional bread pudding comes from Swabia and is made with pieces of stale bread and apples, drenched in a custard-like mixture of milk, sugar, eggs, butter, cinnamon, and vanilla sugar. Everything is combined into a greased baking dish and baked until nicely colored and slightly crispy on top. Ofenschlupfer is often enhanced with raisins and flaked almonds, and it is usually finished with icing sugar after baking. In Swabia, this simple dessert is typically savored warm with vanilla sauce and fresh cream on the side, but it also pairs well with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."
Regensburger Wurst,"Regensburger wurst is a German sausage originating from Regensburg, where it was invented in the late 19th century. The sausages are made from fine or coarse pork and they're smoked and boiled before being sold or consumed. The pork is usually finely ground without fat, then mixed with spices, salt, and small chunks of pork. Once cooked, they can be served hot or cold, or used in dishes such as salads or sandwiches."
Pickert,"Pickert is a German dish originating from Westphalia. It can best be described as a combination of a fritter, a potato pancake, and a waffle. The key ingredients include flour, grated potatoes, eggs, milk, yeast, salt, sugar, oil, and raisins. When the batter is prepared, pickert can be fried or baked. In the past, it was a peasant dish because it is inexpensive and nourishing, just about right for a day of hard work in the fields. Nowadays, people consume it with fruit compotes, sugar, cinnamon, or even leberwurst liver sausage."
Frankfurter Kranz,"Frankfurter Kranz is a classic German cake that originated in Frankfurt and was created around 1735. This cake is known for its distinctive crown shape, symbolizing the city's historical association with the German emperors as the place where coronations took place. The cake consists of multiple layers of sponge cake, which are filled and frosted with a rich buttercream. Often, the layers are interspersed with a layer of red jam, adding a tangy contrast to the creamy filling. The entire cake is then coated with more buttercream and adorned with golden toasted almond brittle, known as krokant, giving it a crunchy texture and an elegant appearance. To finish, the Frankfurter Kranz is typically decorated with cherries or other small fruits, enhancing its festive look. This cake is traditionally served during special occasions and celebrations, and it remains a beloved treat in German bakeries and households. Its rich, buttery flavor and intricate presentation make it a symbol of indulgence and craftsmanship in German baking."
Zwetschgenkuchen,"Zwetschgenkuchen is a beloved German sheet cake that epitomizes the country’s late summer and early autumn baking traditions. Its name, derived from “Zwetschge” meaning prune plum and “Kuchen” meaning cake, signals its starring ingredient: small, dark purple plums with firm flesh and a tart flavor that softens and sweetens when baked. This seasonal dessert is particularly popular in southern Germany, especially in Bavaria and Swabia, where it is also fondly referred to as Pflaumenkuchen or Zwetschgendatschi (""datschen"" being a colloquial Bavarian word denoting the pressing of the prune plums into the dough), depending on the region. Among these regional variants, the Zwetschgendatschi from Augsburg holds a special place in culinary history. Often credited as the birthplace of this specific style of plum cake, Augsburg has helped popularize the sheet-baked version with a yeast dough base and meticulously arranged rows of plums. The city’s association with Zwetschgendatschi is so strong that many Germans consider it an essential part of Augsburg’s gastronomic identity, celebrated at local bakeries and seasonal festivals. The base of Zwetschgenkuchen can vary, with some versions using a rich, buttery shortcrust (Mürbeteig) and others relying on the traditional yeast-leavened dough (Hefeteig) that provides a tender but sturdy foundation for the fruit. The plums are halved and tightly arranged in rows, skin side down, covering the dough in overlapping patterns that resemble the scales of a fish, a signature detail of the Augsburg style. As they bake, the juices seep into the base, creating a harmonious balance of tartness and sweetness, and imparting a vibrant color and flavor. Traditional recipes often include a streusel topping made from flour, sugar, and butter, which adds a delightful crunch and richness, contrasting the juicy, slightly acidic plums beneath. In some variations, bakers might add cinnamon, ground nuts, or even a touch of cardamom for aromatic depth, while others prefer to keep it minimalist to let the plums shine. Zwetschgenkuchen is typically baked in a rectangular tray and cut into squares or slices, making it ideal for sharing at family gatherings, village festivals, or Kaffee und Kuchen (coffee and cake) afternoons. It is commonly served slightly warm or at room temperature, sometimes with a generous dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream to round out the experience. "
Kastaniensuppe,"Kastaniensuppe is a traditional soup originating from Germany. Although there are variations, the soup is usually made with a combination of chestnuts, butter, beef stock, heavy cream, port, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. The boiled and peeled chestnuts are sautéed in butter until light golden. They're covered with the stock, simmered until soft, and then puréed. The cream, port, salt, pepper, and nutmeg are added to the pot, and the soup is then served piping hot. If kastaniensuppe becomes too thick, it's recommended to add more stock. "
Oberschale,"Oberschale in German butchery refers to a specific cut of beef taken from the upper hind leg or the outer thigh of the cow. Given its location on the animal, the oberschale is a fairly lean cut, as it originates from a muscle area that gets a moderate amount of exercise. Oberschale is characterized by its lean, fine-grained muscle fibers. While not as tender as some other cuts like the fillet, its moderate activity level gives the meat a well-defined beef flavor, making it desirable for various culinary applications. This cut is versatile and can be used in various cooking methods. In German cuisine, oberschale is often roasted as a whole joint, especially during festive occasions or Sunday meals. It can also be sliced into steaks or used in stews and pot roasts. Due to its lean nature, it's essential to ensure it doesn't dry out during cooking. When roasting the oberschale, it's beneficial to use techniques that preserve its moisture, such as basting, marinating, or even wrapping it with bacon. For stews or braised dishes, slow cooking is ideal, allowing the meat to become tender and flavorful over time. If cutting into steaks, they should be cooked quickly to avoid drying out. Oberschale's distinct beef flavor pairs well with a variety of ingredients and seasonings. Classic pairings include root vegetables, robust herbs (like rosemary and thyme), and rich sauces or gravies. For stews, the addition of red wine, beef broth, or tomato-based sauces can accentuate its depth of flavor. "
Unterschale,"Unterschale in German butchery refers to a particular cut of beef located in the inner part of the hind leg or the inner thigh of the cow. It is a muscle that receives a moderate amount of exercise, resulting in a cut that is relatively lean but still flavorful. Unterschale is characterized by its lean composition with a smooth texture. As it comes from a portion of the animal that does move, but not excessively, it carries a good balance between tenderness and flavor. This cut is versatile, much like the oberschale. In German cuisine, the unterschale is often roasted, but it can also be used in pot roasts, stews, or even be sliced thinly for certain beef-based dishes. It's essential to use methods that help retain its moisture, given its lean nature. If roasting the unterschale, techniques like basting or marinating can help ensure the meat remains juicy. When used in braises or stews, the slow-cooking process allows the meat to tenderize while soaking up the flavors of the accompanying ingredients. For dishes requiring thin slices, it's recommended to cut against the grain to enhance tenderness. The natural beefiness of the unterschale pairs excellently with a broad spectrum of flavors. Robust herbs like thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves complement its taste. For stews or braised dishes, ingredients like red wine, beef stock, or aromatic vegetables (carrots, onions, celery) can elevate the meat's inherent flavors. "
Hals,"   In German butchery, hals denotes the neck portion of the beef. This cut, taken from the upper section of the cow close to the head, is characteristically more muscular and robust. Due to its high content of connective tissue and muscle fibers, it demands specific cooking techniques to render it tender and palatable. While it's not the premium choice for quick-cooking methods, hals is valued in dishes that require prolonged simmering or braising. When cooked slowly, the fibers and tissues break down, resulting in flavorful and tender meat, making it an ideal choice for hearty stews, soups, and slow-cooked dishes.    "
Eierschecke,"This specialty dessert from Saxony is a sheet cake consisting of three individual layers. Yeast dough is commonly used for the base layer, but a thin sponge cake or a pie crust can be used instead. The middle layer consists of a type of custard which contains quark in addition to butter, milk, eggs, and sugar. The top layer consists of another type of custard which is mixed with vanilla pudding. After these three layers have been assembled, the cake is baked and then cut into rectangular pieces. Eierschecke is traditionally served with a hot cup of coffee and is therefore easily found in most German coffeehouses."
Kalter Hund,"Kalter Hund is a no-bake chocolate biscuit cake that is widely known in Germany and also popular in other parts of Central Europe. The name translates to “cold dog” in German, though it has no connection to animals and instead refers to the cold-set method of preparation and the shape of the loaf tin, which in old mining slang was called a “Hund” or ""dog."" This dessert is made by layering plain butter biscuits (often Leibniz or similar rectangular types) with a rich chocolate glaze or ganache made from cocoa powder, butter, and sometimes coconut oil or cream. Once assembled, the cake is chilled until firm and sliced to reveal a striped pattern of alternating biscuit and chocolate layers. Kalter Hund became especially popular in Germany in the mid-20th century, when simple, accessible ingredients and no-bake methods were in high demand. Its preparation does not require an oven, making it ideal for home kitchens with limited equipment or for occasions when ease and speed are a priority. The texture is dense and slightly crunchy from the biscuits, with a smooth and sweet chocolate component that holds everything together. The dessert is served cold and cut into rectangular slices, often appearing at children’s birthday parties, family gatherings, or holiday celebrations. Over time, variations have emerged, such as adding rum, coffee, or vanilla to the chocolate mixture, or replacing the biscuits with sponge fingers or other cookies. "
Brotsuppe,"Brotsuppe, meaning bread soup, is a humble German dish based on stale bread and meat broth (usually beef) or vegetable broth. Pieces of leftover bread (usually rye bread) are fried in butter or lard alongside onions until nicely colored and crispy before they are added to a hot broth seasoned with salt and pepper and enhanced with aromatic spices such as marjoram, caraway, or nutmeg. Some variations of the soup call for the addition of meat, egg yolks, or cream for extra flavor, and a more filling meal. Brotsuppe is also often referred to as fränkische brotsuppe as it is mainly associated with the region of Franconia, although different versions of the soup have been traditionally consumed in other parts of the country as well. Vegetarian bread soups have been a common dish prepared during Lent, especially in the rural areas. This simple soup is typically served piping hot, and it is often finished with freshly chopped chives, parsley, or lovage on top."
Flaedle,"Flädle is a German pancake consisting of basic ingredients such as flour, eggs, milk or water, sugar, and salt. The thin batter is poured into a lightly greased pan and cooked on both sides, yielding thin and round pancakes which can be both savory and sweet. The former version usually calls for the addition of finely chopped herbs such as parsley, chives, and chervil, while the batter is seasoned with salt, pepper, and sometimes ground nutmeg. Thin strips of these savory pancakes are added to a rich beef or vegetable broth to make the classic Swabian soup called flädlesuppe. Sweet flädle pancakes, on the other hand, are sweetened with sugar and (optionally) vanilla, and they are usually served for breakfast or consumed as a dessert, topped with powdered sugar or paired with jams, marmalades, fruit, or cream."
Halve Hahn,"Halve hahn is a Rhenish sandwich consisting of a split rye roll (röggelchen) that is typically buttered and topped with a thick slice of medium-ripe gouda cheese, pickles, and raw onions. Mustard is commonly added as well. It is popular throughout the Rhineland, especially in the cities of Cologne and Duesseldorf, where it can be found at most restaurants, pubs, and beer gardens. The origins of this dish are debated, but halve hahn most likely originated from Cologne in the 1870s. It is eaten as a snack between gulps of kölsch beer."
Quarkkeulchen,"Originating in Saxony, quarkkeulchen is made by combining quark, mashed potatoes, eggs, flour, and milk or water, and then shaping the mixture into flat cakes which are fried in hot oil or butter until nicely browned on both sides. This sweet specialty is usually flavored with lemon juice or lemon zest, and it is often enhanced with raisins or currants for extra flavor and texture. Qarkkeulchen can be enjoyed warm or chilled, and it is usually topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Applesauce or stewed fruit such as plums and a cup of fresh coffee typically accompany this simple German dessert."
Schnitzel Holstein,"This German dish is a variation of the well-known Wiener schnitzel that originated sometime in the late 19th century. Though it appears in slightly different regional variations, Holstein schnitzel predominantly consists of a breaded and lightly fried veal cutlet that comes served with various additions. A fried egg is always served on top of the schnitzel, while other additions traditionally include smoked salmon, caviar, sardines, capers, or anchovies. The dish is said to have been created at a Berlin restaurant Borchardt’s, and many believe it was named after a German statesman Friedrich von Holstein rather than the Holstein region. This filling main course is usually paired with fried slices of bread or croutons, fried potatoes, red cabbage, gherkins, or beetroot."
Bayerischer Wurstsalat,"Bayerischer Wurstsalat is a traditional salad originating from Bavaria. It's made with Regensburger knockwurst sausage, diced onions, olive oil, wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and paprika. The wurst is peeled and sliced thinly, then tossed with the onions, olive oil, vinegar, and seasonings. Before serving, it's chilled, then dusted with paprika on top. The salad is sometimes also served as an appetizer, and it's recommended to serve it with beets, pickles, bread rolls, and butter."
Westfaelischer Pumpernickel,"First described in 1450 as the black bread of Westphalia, the famous Westfälischer Pumpernickel is a traditional all-rye bread made with either coarsely ground rye meal or a combination of rye flour and whole rye kernels. It can also be flavored with malt or sugar beet syrup. The loaves are placed in lidded pans and baked slowly at a low temperature in steam-filled ovens for anywhere from 16 to 24 hours, which gives pumpernickel its characteristic deep brown, almost black color. Pumpernickel has little or no crust, a pronounced earthy aroma, and a distinctive bittersweet flavor. It is quite dense and moist, and it has an extremely long shelf-life – when shrink-wrapped, it stays fresh for months, while canned pumpernickel can be stored for as long as two years. Even though the unique flavor and texture of pumpernickel goes well with both sweet and savory spreads, the Westphalians typically enjoy it with a thick smear of butter and a topping of ham or liver sausage."
Berliner Knueppel,"Berliner knüppel is a traditional bread roll originating from Berlin. The bread rolls are usually made with a combination of water, flour, milk, yeast, and salt. The ingredients are mixed, the dough is kneaded, and it's then left to rest for a while. The balls of dough are pressed into disks that are folded into a halfcircle, and the dough is then rolled into a short and oblong log. The rolls are baked seam-side up in an oven with steam until golden brown. If properly baked, the crumb should be soft and fluffy, and the crust should be slightly crusty. Berliner knüppel rolls are traditionally served with ground meat patties known as buletten."
Linsen mit Spaetzle,"One of the staples of traditional Swabian cuisine, linsen mit spätzle combines a thick and creamy stew of brown lentils (linsen) with soft egg noodles (spätzle). Lentils are braised with bacon and vegetables and then simmered until soft and fully cooked in meat or vegetable broth, which is usually thickened with roux. The broth is typically enhanced with tomato paste and seasoned with vinegar, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Warm and filling, the lentil stew is then transferred to a plate of boiled spätzle noodles, and it is usually enjoyed with a side of saitenwurst sausages (German string sausages) and a cold beer. This hearty combination makes a frequent appearance in restaurants and university cafeterias in the region, but it is also a beloved home-cooked dish in numerous Swabian households."
Pfefferpotthast,"Pfefferpotthast is a traditional meat stew hailing from Westphalia. It consists of pieces of beef that are simmered in a seasoned broth along with onions, soup vegetables, spices, and herbs. The meat is typically first browned in a little oil or lard before it's cooked with the other ingredients, and the broth is usually thickened with crumbled bread, traditionally with the classic Westphalian pumpernickel rye bread. Spices such as cloves, juniper berries, allspice, bay leaves, salt, and pepper are typically used for seasoning the broth. Warming and flavor-packed, the dish is perfect for a chilly fall or winter lunch or dinner, and it is usually accompanied by pickled gherkins, salt potatoes (Salzkartoffeln), beetroots, and a German beer on the side. The first mention of this Westphalian specialty dates back to 1378 in Dortmund, where an annual Pfefferpotthast Festival is held each September, usually at the end of the month."
Leberknoedel,"Leberknödel is a type of liver dumpling originating from southern Germany and Austria, especially associated with the regions of Bavaria, Swabia, and parts of Austria such as Salzburg and Upper Austria. The dish consists of finely ground liver, commonly from beef or pork (sometimes even veal), combined with stale bread rolls soaked in milk, eggs, onions, fresh herbs, and spices to create a dense, flavorful mixture that can be shaped into large, round dumplings. The liver is typically minced or passed through a grinder until smooth, then carefully mixed with the other ingredients to form a cohesive mass. Once shaped, Leberknödel are gently simmered in salted water or clear broth until firm and cooked through. These dumplings are commonly served in two main ways. They can be presented in a clear beef broth as a soup, known as Leberknödelsuppe, where the dumpling absorbs some of the broth’s flavor while adding richness to the liquid. Alternatively, they are served as a more substantial main dish accompanied by sauerkraut and boiled or mashed potatoes. The flavor is distinctly savory and robust, reflecting the use of liver and the aromatic additions of marjoram, parsley, and occasionally nutmeg or pepper. Preparation requires attention to achieve the correct texture, which should be tender but not falling apart when cooked. Leberknödel has a long history as a practical and nourishing food in rural and urban settings, where no part of the animal was wasted and organ meats were valued for their nutritional content. Today, it appears in both everyday cooking and regional restaurant menus, especially in southern Germany and Austria, where it remains an example of regional comfort food made with simple, accessible ingredients. The dumplings are typically prepared fresh, although they can also be made in advance and reheated in broth. "
Biersuppe,"As the name suggests, beer is the main ingredient of this traditional German soup that has been widely enjoyed in medieval and early modern Europe. There are numerous variations of this specialty, but it is typically made by combining light or dark beer with various other ingredients such as meat broth, water, flour, egg yolks, milk, cream, butter, and stale bread, and then simmering the mixture until it develops a thick and creamy consistency. The soup is usually seasoned with salt and pepper, but sugar, honey, or aromatic spices such as cinnamon and caraway seeds can also be added for extra flavor. Some versions call for the addition of vegetables or cheese for a more filling meal. Interestingly, in the past, beer soup used to be a typical breakfast for the nobility, but it was also commonly prepared in numerous rural households."
Hochrippe,"   In German butchery, hochrippe refers to what is commonly known in English as the upper chuck, standing rib roast, or the upper rib section of the beef. Situated in the forequarter, right next to the neck and above the querrippe, hochrippe is a meaty section with a good amount of intramuscular fat, giving it rich flavor and marbling. The presence of bone and connective tissue also imparts additional taste to the meat when cooked. Because of its composition, the hochrippe is well-suited for various cooking methods. It can be used for roasting, braising, or slow-cooking to break down the connective tissues, resulting in tender and succulent meat.    "
Duennung,"Dünnung in German butchery refers to a set of cuts from the lower belly and flank area of the cow. These are parts of the animal that are regularly exercised and, as a result, contain well-developed muscles with a substantial amount of connective tissue. Due to its location on the cow and the constant movement in this area, dünnung has a pronounced muscle structure, making it somewhat tough in texture. However, this exercise also imparts a deep, beefy flavor to the meat, making it highly desirable for certain preparations. Dünnung is best suited for cooking methods that allow for a long and slow breakdown of the meat's tough fibers and connective tissues. It's ideal for dishes that require braising, stewing, or slow-roasting. In German cuisine, parts of dünnung might be used in traditional stews or even for making certain types of sausages. Due to its inherent toughness, dünnung benefits from a prolonged cooking time at a low temperature. This allows the collagen and connective tissues to melt into the dish, rendering the meat tender and adding richness to the cooking liquid. A preliminary step of browning the meat can enhance the depth of flavor in the final dish. Given its rich beef flavor, dünnung pairs well with hearty and robust ingredients. Root vegetables, grains, and beans can complement the meat in stews or casseroles. Additionally, aromatic herbs and spices, as well as flavorful liquids like beer, wine, or beef stock, can be used to elevate its taste further. "
Schulter,"In German butchery, schulter refers to the shoulder of the cow. Positioned at the front of the animal, it is composed of multiple muscles and a significant amount of connective tissue due to the regular movement of the cow's front legs. Because of the continuous motion in this part of the animal, schulter tends to be tougher than some other cuts. This regular activity, however, endows the meat with a rich, beefy flavor and a good marbling of fat throughout the muscles. The inherent toughness of schulter means it's best suited for slow-cooking methods. When braised, stewed, or slow-roasted, the connective tissue breaks down, rendering the meat tender and flavorful. In German cuisine, schulter might be used in dishes like goulash or other slow-cooked stews. To fully enjoy the schulter, it should be slow-cooked to allow the collagen-rich connective tissues to break down. Braising with aromatic vegetables, herbs, and a flavorful liquid (like broth, wine, or beer) yields especially delightful results. Before this slow cooking, searing the meat can add an extra layer of flavor due to the Maillard reaction. The hearty beef flavor of schulter is enhanced when paired with robust ingredients. Root vegetables, grains, and legumes are natural companions. Additionally, seasonings like garlic, onion, rosemary, thyme, and bay leaves work well. Schulter also benefits from rich sauces, often derived from the very liquids it's cooked in. "
Nuss,"Nuss in German butchery refers to a specific cut of beef situated in the hind leg of the cow, more precisely in the inner part of the thigh. Its name, which translates to ""nut"" in English, hints at its rounded shape. Located deep within the leg muscles, nuss is relatively shielded from rigorous activity, rendering the meat tender compared to some other cuts from the leg. Nuss is recognized for its tender, fine-grained texture, a result of its location on the cow where the muscle experiences less strain. It has a moderate beef flavor, not as intense as some of the more exercised cuts, but still distinct and pleasing. Given its tenderness, nuss is versatile in the kitchen. It can be roasted whole, cut into steaks, or even used for beef Stroganoff or goulash in German cuisine. It's a popular choice for dishes that benefit from tender beef without the need for prolonged cooking. When roasting, it's a good practice to baste nuss to preserve its juiciness. If opting to turn it into steaks or strips, quick cooking methods like grilling or pan-searing work well. It's also a favorable choice for dishes that require beef to be cut into cubes, as its tenderness ensures a pleasant mouthfeel in the final dish. The milder flavor of nuss works harmoniously with a variety of ingredients. Classic herbs like rosemary, thyme, and parsley can enhance its natural taste. When used in stews or sautés, it pairs well with creamy sauces, mushrooms, onions, and even mustards or wines to deepen the dish's complexity. "
Flanke,"In German butchery, flanke refers to a specific cut of beef taken from the abdominal muscles of the cow. Situated below the loin and rib and spanning the belly area, flanke is a long, flat cut. It plays a crucial role in the cow's locomotion and thus has a well-developed muscle structure. Due to its location on the cow and the constant activity of this muscle, flanke tends to be lean and possesses a distinct grain pattern. While it's flavorful due to its well-exercised nature, it's also inherently tough, with pronounced muscle fibers. Flanke's grainy texture lends itself well to specific culinary applications. In German cuisine, it's not as prominently featured as in some other cultures, like in Latin American cuisines where it's the chosen cut for dishes like carne asada. Nonetheless, it's still valued for dishes requiring longer cooking times, like braising, or when meat is thinly sliced against the grain. Marinating the flanke can introduce additional flavors and help tenderize the meat, especially if acidic components are used. Grilling or broiling after marination is common. If cooking whole, it's essential to slice it against the grain to maximize tenderness. Slow-cooking methods, like braising, can also break down its tougher fibers, rendering the meat more tender and succulent. The beefy flavor of the flanke pairs excellently with bold marinades and spices. Ingredients like garlic, chili, citrus, and vinegar can enhance its natural taste. In stews or braised dishes, aromatic vegetables, robust herbs, and flavorful liquids (like beer, wine, or beef broth) further complement flanke's characteristics. "
Boetel,"Bötel is a traditional salt-cured ham hock or pork knuckle hailing from Magdeburg. Just like its cousin from northern Germany, the well-known eisbein (cured and boiled pork knuckle), this cured pork knuckle is typically simmered before it is traditionally served with a side of puréed peas and sauerkraut. The combination is locally known as bötel mit Lehm und Stroh, translating to pork knuckle with clay and straw, where clay refers to the side of puréed peas, while straw refers to the sauerkraut. The term bötel actually means house, estate or farm in Low German, and, therefore, the name of the dish mentioned above would also translate to a house with clay and straw. Other typical accompaniments to the salt-cured and boiled pork knuckle include mashed potatoes, slices of fresh bread, and a cold beer on the side."
Hesse,"In the American, German, and Brazilian systems of primal beef cuts, the shank (hesse, músculo) is the term used for the leg portion of the cow. There are both front and hind shanks, coming from the legs of the steer. The shank is known to be one of the toughest cuts due to the fact that it comes from a part of the animal that is heavily exercised. As such, it contains a high amount of connective tissue, which can be made tender and flavorful through slow, moist-heat cooking methods like braising. The meat from the shank is often used in dishes like soups and stews. Shank is also commonly used for making bone broths and stocks, as the bones from the shank contain marrow, which adds depth and richness to the liquid. "
Huefte,"Hüfte in German butchery refers to a specific cut of beef located around the hip area of the cow. Being situated on the back part of the cow, hüfte comes from a muscle region that is somewhat active but not overly so, which results in meat that is tender yet flavorful. Hüfte is characterized by its moderately tender texture, a middle ground between the highly tender cuts like the fillet and tougher cuts like the shank. It carries a pronounced beefy flavor, a result of its location on the cow, where the muscle gets a good amount of exercise but not to the point of becoming tough. This cut is versatile in German cuisine. It can be roasted as a whole joint or sliced into steaks. Given its balance of tenderness and flavor, hüfte is often chosen for dishes that benefit from a beefy taste but still require a tender bite, such as certain stews, stir-fries, or even carpaccio. When roasting the hüfte, it can be beneficial to sear it first to lock in juices and then finish the cooking process in the oven. If opting for steaks, quick, high-heat methods like grilling or pan-searing are ideal. Marinating can enhance the flavor and add a layer of complexity to the dish. The rich flavor profile of hüfte pairs well with a broad range of ingredients. Robust herbs such as rosemary, thyme, and garlic can accentuate its beefiness. For a more contemporary twist, ingredients like soy sauce, ginger, or even certain fruit-based marinades can offer a delightful contrast. "
Schlachteplatte,"Schlachteplatte is a traditional Bavarian feast that consists of different types of meat and sausages. It typically contains smoked pork chops, slab bacon, bratwurst, blood sausages, liver sausages, bauernwurst, knackwurst, and wienerwurst. Grilled or cooked, the meat varieties are placed on a large serving platter, usually topped with freshly chopped parsley. A typical winter specialty, the dish is traditionally accompanied by cooked sauerkraut, potatoes, gravy, potato dumplings, or bread dumplings. The dish’s name translates as butcher’s plate from the German words Schlachten and Platte, which mean to butcher and platter, respectively. This German meat specialty most certainly got its name after the tradition of preparing it during the slaughter period in Germany."
Mutzbraten,"Mutzbraten is a spit-roasted pork specialty originating from the Thuringia region. It consists of pork meat that is cut into pieces and then soaked in a marinade of water, salt, pepper, marjoram, thyme, and onions. Traditionally roasted over a birch wood fire, this meat dish is typically accompanied by sauerkraut and fresh bread on the side."
Salzwedeler Baumkuchen,"This German variety of the spit cake is sometimes called the king of cakes, as it was served at the courts of German royalty. This layered pastry was invented in the old Hanseatic League town of Salzwedel in Saxony-Anhalt some 200 years ago. Salzwedeler Baumkuchen is prepared using a unique baking process – twelve to fifteen layers of batter are applied layer by layer to a spit and baked over an open fire. The typical ingredients are butter, flour, eggs, vanilla, sugar, and salt. Baking powder is not used. Various ground nuts, marzipan, honey, or brandy can be added as fillings. Spices such as cardamom are used to emphasize the cake’s special aroma. Finally, the cake is either coated with dark chocolate or a sugar glaze."
Kieler Sprotten,"A specialty item from Holstein, kieler sprotte is a type of German smoked sprat that belongs to the herring family and inhabits the Baltic Sea. The whole fish is smoked in a unique way that makes use of a combination of beech, alder, and oak firewood that imparts an exquisite flavor, and a characteristic yellow-golden hue to the otherwise silvery fish. Once smoked, the fish are typically kept in wooden boxes. Even though their name suggests that they come from Kiel, the home of these small fish is actually the nearby village of Eckernförde. They came to be known as kieler sprotten, or sprats from Kiel, because Kiel was the main trading center of this fish delicacy. These small smoked sprats can be found in fresh or canned versions, and they are commonly available at restaurants and markets. Traditionally, the smoked sprats are enjoyed whole, heads and tails included, with slices of rye bread and cold beer on the side."
Senfei,"Senfeier, also known as eier in senfsoße, is a classic German comfort food that consists of boiled eggs smothered in a smooth, and creamy mustard sauce. Typical accompaniments to this vegetarian specialty include boiled or mashed potatoes, rice, wilted spinach, blanched kale, and various vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, cauliflowers, or peas. Fried onions and bacon bits can be added for extra flavor, and the dish can be garnished with freshly chopped parsley or dill on top, if desired. This simple dish is often prepared around Easter because it provides an easy way to use leftover Easter eggs. In Germany, senfeier is typically served for breakfast, brunch, or as a light dinner."
Wibele,"Wibele is a tiny, sweet biscuits made by combining flour, powdered sugar, egg whites, vanilla sugar, and vanilla flavorings. The biscuits or cookies are baked until golden in color and are recognized for their distinctive shape of a figure-eight or a shoe sole. These tiny pastries are believed to date back to 1763, in Langenburg, and they are most commonly attributed to Jakob Christian Carl Wibel, who is thought to have been a court confectioner to the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and created wibele in the Prince’s honor. These sweet treats are available in bakeries, confectioner’s shops, and delicatessen stores. Wibele are often enjoyed as dessert cookies and are usually accompanied by a glass of hot mulled wine. "
Drei im Weggla,"Drei im Weggla is a staple street food in Nuremberg. The sandwich consists of a circular bun that's cut in half and stuffed with three (drei in German) grilled Nürnberger Rostbratwurst sausages with a charred and crunchy skin. The sandwich is completed when the sausages are slathered with sharp yellow mustard. Some vendors even offer sauerkraut on top of it all, but let's be honest, the beauty of this sandwich lies in its simplicity. The bun must be perfectly crisp on the exterior while the inside should be chewy, dense, and yeasty. In the city, Drei im Weggla can be found at restaurants and in numerous food stands, huts, and carts scattered throughout Nuremberg."
Bregenwurst,"Bregenwurst is a traditional sausage originating from Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. The sausage is made from pork, pork belly, and (in the past) either pig or cattle brain. It's often enriched with the addition of white pepper, cumin, mace, and onions. The name Bregenwurst is derived from the word bregen, meaning brain and referring to one of the ingredients used for its production. Bregenwurst is eaten raw as it is, but it's also often boiled or stewed, after which it develops a spreadable texture. In the colder months, the sausage is typically served with kale (grünkohl) and potatoes on the side."
Gruenkohl und Pinkel,"A typical winter dish from Northern Germany, Gruenkohl und Pinkel consists of finely chopped kale that is cooked with lard and onions, accompanied by smoked sausages made from pork meat and grits, called Pinkel. The dish is commonly served with either boiled or fried potatoes. A hearty, nourishing dish like Gruenkohl und Pinkel is commonly accompanied by local beer or wine. Traditionally, Germans celebrate winter with a Gruenkohlfahrt, a long walk to a country inn or a restaurant of their choice, where they eat a dinner of stewed kale and sausages."
Handkaese mit Musik,"Handkäse mit Musik is a German dish originating from Hesse. It consists of hand-formed handkäse (sour milk cheese) that's topped with raw onion vinaigrette. The onion marinade stands for music (Musik) from the name, which comes in the form of flatulence caused by consuming raw onions. However, the real reason why it has music in its name is because in the past, the onions were served on the side, while vinegar and oil were served in tiny jars that made music while the servers carried them on a plate. The dish is often served only with a knife, and it's typically accompanied by bread, caraway seeds, and apfelwein (apple cider) on the side."
Ostfriesentorte,"Ostfriesentorte is a traditional cake originating from Ostfriesen. It's made with a combination of sugar, flour, baking powder, eggs, bourbon, vanilla sugar, salt, and a thickening agent. The yolks and whites are separated, and the yolks are then beaten with vanilla sugar, sugar, hot water, flour, thickening agent, baking powder, and salt. The egg whites are then beaten until stiff and folded in with the stock of spirit raisins. The cake is baked, and it's then smeared with a mix of cream, cream stuff, stock of spirit raisins, and spirit raisins in alternating layers. The top is decorated with cream before the cake is served, while the sides can be garnished with chopped almonds."
Frankfurter Gruene Sosse mit Eiern und Kartoffeln,"Frankfurter grüne soße mit eiern und kartoffeln is a traditional dish originating from Frankfurt. The dish consists of green sauce, potatoes, and hard-boiled eggs. This famous local sauce is made with a mixture of sour cream, spices, and herbs such as chervil, borage, garden cress, salad burnet, parsley, chives, and sorrel. Once prepared, the sauce is served with chopped hard-boiled eggs and small boiled potatoes. This simple local specialty can be found in most traditional restaurants in the area. There are variations on the dish, so it's sometimes served with roasted potatoes instead of boiled potatoes."
Kohlwurst,"Kohlwurst is a traditional sausage that is particularly popular in northern Germany, especially in regions like Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony. Its name translates to ""cabbage sausage"", as it is often served with kale (Grünkohl) or other cabbage-based dishes. Kohlwurst is typically made from pork, including fattier cuts, and is seasoned with salt, pepper, marjoram, and other spices. The sausage is usually smoked, giving it a rich and robust smoky flavor. It has a coarse texture due to the use of chunky pork cuts. The sausage is usually boiled or simmered before serving, often in stews or as a standalone dish with vegetables. The most common traditional use of Kohlwurst is in the dish ""Grünkohl mit Pinkel,"" where the sausage is boiled alongside kale and potatoes, allowing it to absorb the flavors of the vegetables and broth. It is typically served with boiled potatoes or kale and sometimes alongside other sausages like Pinkel or Bregenwurst. Kohlwurst is mostly enjoyed during the colder months, especially when kale is in season, making it part of hearty, warming winter meals."
Hausfreunde,"Hausfreunde are classic German Christmas cookies. In order to make them, a few layers of crispy shortcrust pastry are covered with apricot jam and almond paste, then dipped in dark chocolate and garnished with caramelized walnuts on top. The ingredients usually include flour, sugar, butter, eggs, salt, vanilla, almond paste, dark chocolate, apricot jam, and walnut halves. Before serving, the chocolate should be left to fully set. The name of these cookies means friend of the house, probably because they are easy to prepare and keep for unexpected guests during the festive Christmas season."
Kaesesahnetorte,"Käsesahnetorte, literally meaning ""cheese cream cake,"" is a traditional German and Austrian no-bake cheesecake, particularly popular in southern Germany and Austria, with roots in regions like Bavaria. This airy, refreshing dessert consists of a quark-based filling—a soft, fresh cheese—combined with whipped cream, gelatin, and occasionally tangerines or other fruit, all layered between rounds of light sponge cake (biskuitboden). Served cold, käsesahnetorte is prized for its fluffy, mousse-like texture and mildly sweet flavor, making it a favorite in kaffee und kuchen (coffee and cake) traditions. Its origin likely dates back to the early 20th century, when both quark and gelatin became more accessible in home kitchens. Käsesahnetorte is a dessert that stands as a lighter, fresher alternative to denser baked cheesecakes, such as the American New York-style cheesecake or the heavier German käsekuchen."
Brezenknoedel,"Brezenknödel is a type of bread dumpling made from soft pretzels, originating from the southern regions of Germany, particularly Bavaria. It is a variation of the more widespread Semmelknödel, which are dumplings made from day-old bread rolls. In the case of Brezenknödel, stale or leftover pretzels serve as the base ingredient, giving the dish a slightly saltier flavor and denser texture due to the unique characteristics of pretzel dough. The name combines Brezen, the Bavarian word for pretzel, and Knödel, which means dumpling in German. The preparation of Brezenknödel begins by slicing or cubing stale soft pretzels and soaking them in warm milk until softened. The mixture is then combined with sautéed onions, fresh parsley, eggs, and a pinch of nutmeg or black pepper for seasoning. The dough is gently mixed to avoid becoming too compact, then shaped by hand into balls. These dumplings are simmered in hot water until firm and cooked through, typically for 15 to 20 minutes. The pretzel base gives them a darker color and richer flavor compared to dumplings made from plain white bread. Brezenknödel is commonly served as a side dish with hearty Bavarian meals, especially those featuring meat and rich gravies such as Schweinebraten (roast pork), wild game, or mushroom sauces. It is also occasionally served with vegetarian dishes, particularly those involving creamy or wine-based sauces. The pretzel dumplings absorb sauce well, making them ideal for savory pairings. In many Bavarian households and restaurants, Brezenknödel is a way to repurpose leftover pretzels, reflecting a practical and resource-conscious approach to cooking. In recent years, Brezenknödel has gained modest popularity outside Bavaria, particularly in southern Austria and parts of Germany where Alpine culinary influence is strong. It is also occasionally featured in modern German restaurants that specialize in regional cuisine, offering diners a chance to experience a dish that connects the simple pretzel with the broader category of central European dumplings. "
Kluten,"Kluten is a German dumpling that is made with flour, milk, eggs, and butter. The batter is dropped into boiling water or soup using a spoon, and it is then cooked until done, yielding small and soft dumplings. These dumplings have a very mild flavor, so they pair well with both sweet and savory specialties. Kluten are often featured in dishes such as sweet buttermilk vanilla pudding (buttermilksuppe) and sour cherry soup (kirschsuppe)."
Pinkel,"Pinkel is a traditional sausage from the northwestern region, particularly associated with Lower Saxony, Bremen, and Oldenburg, as well as parts of Friesland. It is commonly eaten during the winter months, especially alongside the regional dish Grünkohl und Pinkel (kale and sausage). Pinkel sausage is made from a combination of pork fat, oat groats (or barley), onions, and a variety of spices. Despite being a sausage, it's relatively coarse in texture due to the inclusion of grains like oats. "
Gaisburger Marsch,"A German specialty originating from Swabia, gaisburger marsch is a meat stew based on beef cooked with a rich meat broth and vegetables. Once ready, the beef is usually cut into bite-sized pieces, accompanied by potatoes, carrots, and spätzle, all drizzled with the broth. Warm and packed with flavors, the dish is typically topped with roasted onions, parsley, and chives. There are several stories behind the name of this classic dish, which translates as the march of Gaisburg in English. Some say the stew was a favorite among officer candidates who would march to one of the Gaisburg restaurants to have a bowl of it, while other sources credit the wives of certain imprisoned Gaisburg locals for the creation of this stew. Regardless of who created the dish, this hearty Swabian stew remains a common traditional specialty beloved by many."
Rahmschwammerl,"Rahmschwammerl is a traditional Bavarian dish made with a combination of mushrooms, bacon, onions, butter, flour, stock, heavy cream, sour cream, and garlic paste. It's best to use both fresh and dried mushrooms for this dish. The ingredients are sautéed, then simmered over low heat until the mushrooms become soft. Once done, it's recommended to enrich the creamy mushroom sauce with chives, then serve the rahmschwammerl as a side dish with bread dumplings, ideally accompanied by a fresh green salad."
Agnes Bernauer Torte,"A signature specialty of the Krönner Confectionery and Café, Agnes Bernauer torte is a Bavarian almond meringue layer cake filled with coffee buttercream. The cake is comprised of several light and airy almond meringue discs that are layered with coffee buttercream filling and roasted almond flakes, then finished off with a thin layer of cream coating and some more roasted almonds on top. This original delicacy was created to honor a young lady called Agnes Bernauer, Duke Albert III of Bavaria’s beloved one, who was condemned to death by drowning in the Danube River by Albert’s father, Duke Ernst. Apart from this special dessert, the tragic history of Agnes Bernauer had also been the inspiration of renowned Friedrich Hebbel’s eponymous tragedy, as well as Carl Orff’s folk musical Die Bernauerin. Mildly sweet and with a nice crunch, this classic sweet treat is available only at the Krönner coffee house located in Straubing and the one in Garmisch-Partenkirchen."
Magdeburger Schmalzkuchen,"Magdeburger schmalzkuchen is a small, deep-fried pastry, considered a local specialty in the city of Magdeburg. It usually consists of yeast dough flavored with vanilla extract or vanilla sugar and lemon zest or juice. Typically rectangular or diamond-shaped, the fried pastries are consumed warm, dusted with confectioners' sugar. These small doughy pillows coated with confectioners' sugar are a staple at festivals, carnivals, and Christmas markets throughout the country."
Prinzregententorte,"A Bavarian specialty dessert called prinzregententorte is a smooth, chocolate-covered layer cake with a chocolate buttercream filling. The cake is comprised of thin cake layers that are smeared with chocolate buttercream and then finished off with a satin-like chocolate coating. It is sometimes enhanced with apricot or raspberry preserves and is usually adorned with whipped cream or chocolate cream and chocolate shavings on top. Originally, the cake had eight layers which represented the eight districts of Bavaria, but since there are only seven Bavarian districts today, the cake nowadays typically features seven layers. Prinzergententorte was created in honor of Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, who later became Prince Regent, thus the name of the cake. A piece of this authentic German dessert can be savored in numerous cake shops found throughout the region."
Kirschenmichel,"Kirschenmichel is a buttery German bread pudding enriched with sweet cherries. A common dessert in southern Germany, this sweet treat is typically flavored with cinnamon, cloves, Kirsch liqueur, vanilla extract, or almond extract. Moist and sweet, this bread pudding can be enjoyed warm, at room temperature, or chilled. It is usually dusted with powdered sugar and accompanied by vanilla custard, whipped cream, or ice cream. Kirschenmichel is generally consumed as a simple after-lunch dessert, but it is sometimes eaten for lunch as well."
Sahnehering,"Pickled or salted herring fillets are doused in a sweet and sour sauce of cream, yogurt, pickling liquid, and fresh herbs along with apples, pickles, and onions in this German specialty called sahnehering. Typical varieties of herring fillets used in this specialty include bismarck herring, matjes herring, or Baltic herring, and the dish is often finished with freshly chopped chives on top before serving. The refreshing combination is usually enjoyed chilled with boiled jacket potatoes and a cucumber salad on the side, but it can also be spread on a slice of buttered brown bread. Sahnehering is usually consumed as a side or snack, and it is a traditional fasting dish that's mainly prepared in northern Germany and the Rhineland."
Thueringer Rotwurst,"This is a specialty blood sausage made from pork, a small amount of pork liver, and spices and seasonings such as salt, black pepper, marjoram, allspice, cloves, and onions. It can often be found in butcher shops throughout Thuringia, and it has been prepared and consumed for centuries at farm slaughter festivals. Today, it is produced all over Thuringia by several major producers. Thüringer Rotwurst is known in the region as the ""queen of black pudding""."
Muscheln Rheinische Art,"Muscheln rheinische art is a traditional dish originating from the Rhine region. The dish is made with mussels from the North Sea and white wine from the middle and upper Rhine region as key ingredients. The mussels are cooked in vegetable stock and white wine, then served in their shells with a bit of stock. The dish is traditionally accompanied by brown bread and butter on the side. It’s usually served as an appetizer, but it can also be served as the main course. There are a few variations on the dish, so beer is sometimes added to the stock instead of wine."
Brathering,"Brathering is a traditional fish dish originating from Germany, consisting of marinated fried herring. Fresh herrings are rolled in flour or breaded, pan-fried, and marinated in a mixture of white wine vinegar, onions, sugar, salt, pepper, mustard seeds, and bay leaves. The dish is traditionally served cold, and it’s typically accompanied by fried potatoes, rösti, or potato salad. The herrings can also be used in sandwiches, and nowadays canned brathering can be bought in most stores. The dish is usually enjoyed for lunch or as a snack at street food stands."
Kruestchen Schnitzel,"Krüstchen schnitzel is a traditional dish originating from Frankfurt and the surrounding areas. The dish usually consists of a schnitzel that's served on a slice of toasted bread or rye bread. It's topped with a fried egg and traditionally served with french fries, pickles, roast potatoes, or potato salad on the side. The meat used for the preparation of the schnitzel is typically pork. The meat is pounded thin, coated with flour, dipped in beaten eggs, dredged in breadcrumbs, and then fried in butter or a mixture of oil and butter until golden brown and crispy. "
Speckpfannkuchen,"Speckpfannkuchen (lit. pancakes with bacon) is a type of savory pancake from Germany combined with cubes or strips of bacon. The bacon can either be on top of the pancake or used as a filling, but it’s always first fried before being incorporated into the dish. Besides bacon, the pancake may be modified to include cheese or onions. It is eaten as an appetizer or a hearty breakfast complemented with pickled cucumbers or a green salad."
Bremer Klaben,"This rich sweet bread is made with a heavy yeast dough mixed with candied fruit and nuts. It is one of the many traditional specialties of Bremen's cuisine. The recipe for Klaben dates back to the 16th century, when bakers in Hanseatic League cities gained access to exotic ingredients they were able to obtain through their member cities. The sweet bread is filled with raisins, almonds, various nuts, and orange and lemon peel. It is not sugar-dusted after baking, as opposed to Dresdner Stollen. The distinctive taste of this holiday favorite comes from the addition of cardamom, rum, or nutmeg. Klaben is usually baked at the beginning of December, and it can stay fresh until Easter."
Querrippe,"   In German butchery, querrippe refers to the cross rib portion of the beef, situated in the forequarter and extending from the lower part of the chuck down to the brisket. This cut comprises a mix of muscle and bone, with layers of fat and connective tissue interspersed throughout. The presence of the rib bone lends additional flavor to the meat. Due to its rich composition, the querrippe is especially suited for slow-cooking methods like braising or stewing. When subjected to prolonged heat, the connective tissues break down, yielding a tender and flavorsome result. This makes the querrippe a popular choice for dishes that emphasize depth of flavor and succulence.    "
Meenzer Spundekaes,"Originally from Mainz, meenzer spundekäs is a type of traditional cream cheese dip or spread. It typically consists of a mixture of cream cheese, quark, sour cream, finely chopped onions, and garlic, seasoned with sweet paprika, salt, and freshly ground pepper. The dip is usually topped with sliced onions and served with salty pretzels. It is typically paired with a glass of wine or a cold beer. Boiled potatoes and radishes can also accompany the dip, or they can be smeared on bread. Rich and creamy, this cheese dip is a staple at restaurants and wine taverns throughout the region. Besides Mainz, the dip is also commonly consumed throughout Rheinhessen and Rheingau regions. Its name is derived from the German words Spund, referring to the conical cork of a wooden wine barrel, and Käse, meaning cheese. Every year, a Spundekäs competition is held in honor of this Mainz specialty, known as Rheingau sucht den Super-Spundekäs, meaning Rhine District seeks the Super-Spundekäs."
Steckruebeneintopf,"Steckrübeneintopf is a traditional stew based on rutabagas and a combination of other root vegetables such as carrots, onions, and potatoes. All vegetables are usually cut into small cubes and then cooked in a vegetable broth seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and (optionally) dried herbs. Although this stew is typically considered a vegetarian dish, it is often enhanced with pieces of ham or sliced sausages. Rich and savory, the stew is usually eaten hot with slices of fresh, buttered bread. Eating rutabagas in Germany has long been associated with times of hardship as rutabaga dishes were a type of survival food for the war-stricken families in the country during both world wars of the 20th century. There is even a period during World War I that is known as Hunger winter or Steckrübenwinter, meaning Rutabaga winter. This root vegetable has nevertheless made its comeback and is nowadays available at numerous vegetable markets and supermarkets across Germany."
Bauernomelett,"Bauernomelett or farmer's omelet is a simple German dish that's usually served for breakfast, but sometimes also for lunch or dinner. It's made with a combination of bacon, onions, potatoes, parsley, eggs, and milk. The bacon, onions, and potatoes are sautéed slowly, and when the potatoes start to turn golden brown, a mixture of eggs and milk is poured into the pan. Cooked over high heat, the omelet can be turned over and browned on top, or it can be folded in half before serving. It's recommended to serve this hearty omelet with pickles on the side. If desired, the dish can be enriched with grated Emmentaler cheese while the omelet is cooking."
Herrencreme,"Herrencreme is a simple German dessert made with vanilla pudding, whipped cream, and grated bittersweet chocolate. It is usually flavored with an aromatic alcoholic beverage such as rum, whiskey, or cognac. Sweet and creamy, the dessert is typically served chilled in cups or bowls, topped with fruit, and sprinkled with chocolate shavings. A typical after-lunch sweet treat, herrencreme is also often served on festive occasions such as christenings, weddings, or Christmas."
Dibbelabbes,"Originally from Saarland, dibbelabbes is a combination of grated potatoes, leeks, and diced smoked or cured meat such as bacon or pork belly. This traditional German hash is typically seasoned with marjoram, nutmeg, parsley, salt and pepper, and then cooked in a large pot. The dish got its name from the Saarland local dialect’s words Dibbe, meaning a stewpot, and Labbes, which refers to a big piece of something. Traditionally accompanied by home-cooked apple purée, the dish is served while still hot, usually with a glass of beer or wine on the side. There's a variation on dibbelabbes called schales, consisting of the same ingredients, but made in a different way - it's baked in the oven."
Spannrippe,"In German butchery, spannrippe is a cut of beef derived from the forequarter, specifically the lower rib section, which is situated towards the belly of the animal. Spannrippe contains relatively lean meat with noticeable fibrous muscles. Its location on the animal means it has a good amount of connective tissue. Due to the exercise this part of the cow gets, it has a pronounced beefy flavor. Like other tough cuts, spannrippe is ideally suited for slow-cooking methods that allow its collagen and connective tissues to break down over time. It can be braised, stewed, or slow-roasted. In German cuisine, it might be used in hearty stews or traditional soups. To harness the full potential of the spannrippe, it's best to cook it slowly and gently. The collagen-rich tissues will break down, turning into gelatin, which adds richness to the dish. Browning the meat before stewing or braising can add depth to the final flavor. The beefy taste of the spannrippe pairs well with robust flavors. Root vegetables, aromatic herbs, and rich broths or wines can complement and enhance the meat's inherent flavors. Ingredients like onions, garlic, bay leaves, and juniper berries are often used in German dishes with such cuts. "
Weinkraut,"Weinkraut is a traditional side dish and a version of the famous sauerkraut. It's usually made with a combination of sauerkraut, butter, onions, sweet apples (e.g. Red Delicious), bay leaves, juniper berries, white wine, and peppercorns. The onions are sautéed in butter until translucent, and then mixed with thin strips of apple, sauerkraut, juniper berries, bay leaves, peppercorns, water, and white wine. The dish is cooked over low heat until the sauerkraut is not too dry nor too liquid and it's then served with grilled sausages."
"Birnen, Bohnen und Speck","This traditional North German specialty uses a combination of pears, green beans, and bacon (birnen, bohnen und speck in German), yielding a uniquely flavored dish. Peeled and cored cooking pears (kochbirnen) are simmered with French beans or string beans along with pieces of smoked streaky bacon until tender. They're cooked in an aromatic broth which is seasoned with summer savory, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper. Sweet, savory, and smoky, the dish has been traditionally prepared from late summer through early fall, and it is typically enjoyed with a side of potatoes or German dumplings (klößen)."
Westfaelische Quarkspeise,"Westfälische quarkspeise is a trifle dessert with layers of creamy German quark and whipped cream, tart cherries (such as morello cherries), and crumbled pumpernickel (slightly sweet dark rye bread). Typically flavored with kirsch, amaretto, or rum and vanilla sugar, the dessert is usually assembled in a glass serving dish and enjoyed chilled, and it is often enhanced with chopped or shredded semisweet chocolate. Although quick and easy to make, this cold layered dessert packs quite a punch of flavor, especially after several hours of setting, which allows for the flavors to combine. This simple sweet treat uses two traditional German ingredients - German quark and Westphalian pumpernickel - which (combined with the tart cherries and additional flavorings) contribute to the dessert’s unique blend of sweet, slightly sour, earthy, and fruity flavors."
Kartoffelwurst,"Kartoffelwurst (lit. potato sausage) is a traditional sausage. This type of wurst is usually made with a combination of pork or beef, bacon, stewed onions, potatoes, and spices that vary from one region to another. Offal or groats are often added to the mixture. The sausage should consist of 50-70% chopped pork or beef and 30-50% of potatoes. Common spices used for kartoffelwurst include nutmeg, salt, and black pepper. The sausage mixture is stuffed into casings, and it's then usually fried before consumption. The texture of fried sausages is often mushy due to the fact that fat and gelatin liquefy when heated. It's recommended to serve kartoffelwurst with sauerkraut or boiled potatoes."
Kalbsleber Berliner Art,"Kalbsleber Berliner Art is a traditional dish originating from Berlin. The dish is usually made with a combination of calves' liver, flour, apples, butter, onions, oil, salt, and pepper. The onions are sautéed in oil, while the apples are sautéed in butter in another pan. The liver is rinsed, patted dry, sprinkled with flour, and browned in the pan where the onions have previously been sautéed. Once browned on both sides, it's seasoned with salt and pepper and topped with onions and apples. This specialty from Berlin is traditionally served with mashed potatoes on the side."
Thueringer Leberwurst,"At least 51% of the ingredients for this liver sausage must come from Thuringia. Added spices and seasonings such as salt, braised onions, ground pepper, and Thuringian marjoram give this sausage its special flavor. After preparation, the sausages are cooled and cold-smoked over beech wood until they reach a golden-yellow color. This delicacy enjoys a reputation as one of the most beloved sausages of the region. The tradition of preparing these sausages is as long as the Thuringian butcher's trade itself. Nowadays, Thüringer Leberwurst is still made at farm slaughter festivals and eaten fresh from the sausage pan. "
Plockwurst,"Plockwurst is a traditional dry-cured sausage that’s shaped into a block. It originates from Germany, but it’s also popular in the neighboring Austria. The sausage is made with a combination of lean beef and bits of connective tissue, semi-fat pork, back fat and trimmings, salt, sugar, black pepper, paprika, coriander, and dextrose. After it’s been stuffed in the casing, plockwurst is fermented at 20°C (68°F) for 3 days, smoked for 24 hours, and dried for 5 weeks before it’s ready for consumption."
Bergische Waffles,"Bergische waffles are traditional German waffles originating from the Bergisches Land area. They’re usually made with a combination of flour, sugar, butter, vanilla, eggs, baking powder, and milk. What differentiates these waffles is that they are always heart-shaped but also more crisp and less dense than their Belgian cousins. Traditional accompaniments include whipped cream and pitted sour cherries. Bergische waffles are usually not served for breakfast but as an afternoon treat, especially on Sundays, when they’re occasionally served with rice pudding. "
Saure Zipfel,"Saure zipfel is a traditional winter dish hailing from Franconia, consisting of bratwurst sausages that are simmered in a vinegar-based broth alongside onions, carrots, sugar, salt, and spices such as juniper berries, pepper, mustard seeds, and bay leaves. The broth is typically enhanced with a splash of white wine, and once ready, it is typically enjoyed piping hot, accompanied by slices of brown bread or a fresh pretzel bun for dipping on the side. When translated, the name of this dish means sour ends, which refers to the sharp flavor imparted to the sausages by the tangy broth. Saure zipfel is also often referred to as blaue zipfel (blue ends) due to the slightly bluish hue the sausages get once they’ve been cooked."
Bayerische Brezensuppe,"Bayerische brezensuppe is a traditional Bavarian soup made with pretzels (brezen in German), which are known for their distinct twisted shape and savory taste. The soup is typically prepared by boiling pretzels in broth until they are soft. It may also include other ingredients for added flavor, like onions, garlic, various herbs, and spices. The soup is often blended to a creamy consistency before serving. "
Hoorische,"Hoorische is a type of potato dumpling hailing from the German region of Saarland. The dumplings are typically made with a combination of both grated raw potatoes and boiled potatoes, along with ingredients such as eggs, flour, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. They usually take an elongated, either oblong or egg-shaped form and are simmered in boiling salted water. The name of these dumplings means hairy, referring to their rough, hairy-like outer surface due to coarsely grated potatoes. A creamy bacon gravy and a side of sauerkraut or apple sauce usually accompanies the dumplings. Just like other German potato dumplings, these also make for an excellent accompaniment to various meat specialties."
Herrentorte,"Herrentorte is a layered German cake known for its balanced combination of rich chocolate and subtle bitterness, created to appeal to those who prefer desserts that are less sugary and more refined in flavor. Its name means “gentlemen’s cake” in German, a reference to the fact that it was conceived as a dessert suited to mature tastes, with an emphasis on cocoa and occasionally coffee or liqueur notes rather than pronounced sweetness. The cake is believed to have developed in German-speaking Europe during the 20th century, emerging in bakeries that specialized in layer cakes and fine pastries. Though there is no single codified recipe, Herrentorte typically consists of several thin layers of sponge cake or shortcrust pastry, which are filled and covered with a bittersweet chocolate cream or a smooth dark ganache. Some variations incorporate thin spreads of fruit preserves, such as currant or apricot jam, to provide a gentle contrast to the chocolate. The surface is usually finished with a glossy chocolate glaze, and in some versions, decorated with chocolate shavings or piped cream. While the ingredients themselves are not unusual (flour, eggs, butter, sugar, and cocoa) the preparation requires care to produce an even, firm structure that slices cleanly. The restrained sweetness and focus on cacao make Herrentorte distinct from richer cream cakes and heavily frosted layer cakes more common in other European confectionery traditions. The cake is commonly served in German cafés, pastry shops, and on special occasions, presented in thin slices alongside coffee or dessert wine. Because of its understated taste, it appeals to those who appreciate desserts with deeper roasted and bitter notes rather than overtly sugary profiles. "
Kerbelsuppe,"Kerbelsuppe is a traditional soup originating from Germany. The soup is usually made with a combination of chervil, chicken stock, parsley, egg yolks, heavy cream, salt, and black pepper. The chervil is chopped and the stems are simmered in chicken stock over medium heat. The chervil leaves are puréed with cream and parsley. The egg yolks are whisked in the cream mixture, and it's then added to the pot with the stock. The soup is seasoned with salt and pepper and served piping hot. Kerbelsuppe is traditionally served on the Thursday before Good Friday."
Rote Wurst,"Rote Wurst is a traditional sausage that is especially popular in the Swabian region of southern Germany, mostly Baden-Württemberg. It is known for its distinctive red color, which comes from the addition of paprika and other seasonings. The sausage is typically made from finely ground pork or a mixture of pork and beef. It has a smooth texture and is usually pre-cooked and then either smoked or steamed, giving it a rich, savory flavor. One of the most common ways to prepare Rote Wurst is by grilling, particularly over an open flame, which adds a smoky, crisp exterior while keeping the inside juicy and flavorful. It's a popular street food, often served in a bread roll with mustard, much like a hot dog. It can also be sliced and served with traditional sides like potato salad, sauerkraut, or simply with bread and mustard. "
Griessnockerlsuppe,"Grießnockerlsuppe is a clear broth soup featuring small, oval-shaped semolina dumplings, and it originates from Austria, particularly associated with Viennese and Bavarian cuisine. This comforting dish is commonly found in alpine regions and is a staple in Austrian households as well as in German-speaking parts of Central Europe. Its history is rooted in rural and urban kitchens alike, where cooks developed various methods for stretching ingredients into nourishing meals. Semolina, being inexpensive and widely available, became a popular base for dumplings. Over time, semolina dumplings found a place in soups, and Grießnockerlsuppe became a fixture on menus ranging from home dinners to multi-course meals in finer establishments. In Vienna, it has been present in cookbooks and culinary records since at least the 19th century, often described in relation to soups served as part of larger meals or holiday feasts. The dumplings are made by combining fine semolina with butter, eggs, salt, and sometimes a touch of nutmeg. The mixture is left to rest, allowing the semolina to hydrate and firm up. Once ready, small spoonfuls are shaped into quenelle-like ovals and gently poached in simmering broth or water until they rise and become light and tender. The broth is typically a clear beef or chicken consommé, prepared with care to bring depth and clarity to the soup without overpowering the mild flavor of the dumplings. Occasionally, chives or parsley are sprinkled on top for color and freshness. Shaping the dumplings requires attention to texture and timing; if the semolina is too coarse or the mixture under-rested, the dumplings can fall apart or remain dense. Many home cooks have learned by trial and repetition, often passing down their own approach through generations. Some recipes advise testing one dumpling first before poaching the rest, ensuring the consistency is right before committing the full batch. Grießnockerlsuppe is often served as a first course during formal meals but also appears regularly as a light lunch or dinner, especially during colder months. It is found in Gasthäuser across Austria and southern Germany, and is a common offering at weddings, Sunday lunches, and festive gatherings. "
Krautkrapfen,"Krautkrapfen is a savory dish from the Swabian region of southern Germany, particularly associated with Allgäu. It consists of a rolled pasta dough filled with finely chopped sauerkraut, sometimes combined with small amounts of bacon or minced meat, then sliced into rounds and browned in a pan before being simmered in broth or baked. The result is a hearty and compact meal with deep ties to rural cooking in areas where cabbage preservation was a necessity during colder months. Historically, Krautkrapfen emerged as a way to stretch simple, available ingredients through resourceful preparation. The dish shares similarities with other German dumpling or pasta dishes such as Maultaschen but maintains its identity through its spiral structure and distinctive sauerkraut filling. It was particularly common among farming communities who relied on fermented cabbage and homemade pasta as reliable staples during long winters. Preparation begins with making a firm, egg-based dough that is rolled out thinly. The sauerkraut, often sautéed with onions and sometimes bacon, is spread evenly across the dough, which is then rolled into a tight log and sliced into thick rounds. These pieces are pan-fried cut-side down until browned, then steamed or baked with a bit of broth until tender. The process results in a combination of crispy edges and soft interiors, with the tang of the sauerkraut balancing the richness of the dough and fat. A notable feature of Krautkrapfen is its versatility; it can be adapted depending on whether it is intended as a main course or side, and whether it is enriched with meat or kept vegetarian. In some families, it is eaten with a spoonful of sour cream or paired with a simple salad. It is served both at home and in regional restaurants that focus on local cuisine, and it holds a place as a comforting meal associated with shared, modest ingredients prepared with care. "
Matrosenfleisch,"Matrosenfleisch is a traditional meat dish originating from Bremen. The dish is usually made with a combination of beef tenderloin, bacon, flour, butter, onions, parsley, beef stock, sour cream, lemon peel, capers, marjoram, salt, and pepper. The beef steaks are seasoned with salt and pepper and wrapped in bacon. One side is dredged in flour and the steaks are then shortly browned in butter on both sides. The meat is removed from the pan and the onions and parsley are sautéed in the same pan. They're sprinkled with flour and stirred until the flour is absorbed. Stock and sour cream are added to the pan along with the remaining ingredients and the steaks. The dish is slowly simmered until the meat is fully tender and the dish is then ready to be enjoyed."
Wollwurst,"Wollwurst is a Bavarian white sausage originating from southern Germany, particularly in regions such as Upper Bavaria and Swabia. It is a finely textured, pale sausage made primarily from veal and pork, similar in composition to Weisswurst but distinct in its preparation and appearance. The name ""Wollwurst"" refers to the sausage's unique surface texture, which becomes slightly fuzzy or woolly after cooking due to the lack of a casing. This gives the sausage a soft, delicate outer layer that sets it apart from other similar sausages. The meat mixture is seasoned mildly, often with parsley, lemon zest, white pepper, mace, and salt, and then filled directly into hot water without an outer casing, allowing it to poach and firm up into shape. Once cooked, Wollwurst is typically cooled and stored until ready to be served. It is most commonly eaten by lightly frying it in butter, sometimes after briefly dipping it in milk, which enhances its softness and gives the exterior a subtle browning without becoming crisp. It is usually served with potato salad, pretzels, or sweet mustard, though it can also accompany other regional side dishes. Though less internationally known than Weisswurst, Wollwurst holds a steady place in Bavarian culinary culture, particularly appreciated for its smooth texture and gentle flavor. It is often available in local butcher shops and markets, prepared fresh and meant to be cooked shortly before eating. "
Buttermilchsuppe,"Buttermilchsuppe is a traditional buttermilk soup. This creamy dish combines a mixture of cooked buttermilk, whole milk, flour, and potato mash with fried bacon and onions. It is usually flavored with lemon juice and served hot, garnished with chopped chives, and accompanied by slices of rye bread. Typically eaten for lunch, this soup was traditionally prepared in the Province of Pomerania, a former German territory. All the soup’s ingredients were commonly made at home, and the dish was once considered food of the poor."
Schmierwurst,"Schmierwurst, along with mettwurst and teewurst, belongs to the category of uncooked or raw sausages (rohwurst) that are typically fermented and smoked. The sausage usually consists of finely ground pork, bacon, and spices such as white pepper and coriander, which are combined into a smooth mixture and then added into a natural or artificial casing. The preparation of the final product involves fermentation and gentle smoking, yielding a soft sausage that is perfectly good to be enjoyed without additional cooking and can easily be spread over a slice of bread. It is this distinctive soft and spreadable nature of the sausage that has probably been the reason why it had earned the name schmierwurst, meaning smear sausage or sausage spread."
Frankfurter Rippchen,"Frankfurter Rippchen is a cured and lightly smoked pork cutlet or ribs dish from Frankfurt am Main, a city in the Hesse region of Germany. The name refers to cured, lightly smoked pork ribs or cutlets, which are gently heated in hot water before serving. Unlike grilled or barbecued ribs, Frankfurter Rippchen are not roasted or crisped but instead prepared in a way that preserves their tenderness and moist texture. The dish is commonly served in taverns and cider houses throughout Frankfurt and the surrounding areas, where it is a familiar part of local menus, especially when paired with apple wine (Apfelwein) and other regional sides. The preparation of Frankfurter Rippchen begins with a pork cutlet that has been cured and cold-smoked, giving the meat a subtle smoky aroma without overpowering flavor. The meat is then gently simmered or steamed in water or broth, often without added spices, to maintain its soft consistency and allow the natural flavor of the pork to come through. It is typically served hot, accompanied by sides such as sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, or bread, along with mustard. The focus is on mildness and balance rather than strong seasoning or sauce, which reflects the broader character of Hessian cooking. This dish has strong ties to Frankfurt's working-class food culture and its apple wine taverns (Apfelweinkneipen), where meals are designed to be hearty but not heavy. The combination of Rippchen with tangy sauerkraut and sour apple wine creates a balanced and satisfying meal, especially popular in colder months. In some variations, the meat may be served cold or with different cuts depending on the butcher, but the core elements, light curing, gentle cooking, and simple sides, remain consistent. While not widely known outside Hesse, it is an enduring feature of local menus and is commonly offered during regional festivals and public celebrations, often alongside other Hessian specialties like Handkäse or Grüne Soße."
Frankfurter Rindswurst,"Frankfurter Rindswurst is a traditional German beef sausage from Frankfurt, known for its firm texture, smoky aroma, and savory, mildly spiced flavor. Unlike the classic Frankfurter Würstchen, which is made from pork, Rindswurst is made exclusively from beef, making it a popular choice among Frankfurt's Jewish and Muslim communities when it was first introduced in 1894 by butcher Gref-Völsing. This sausage is coarsely ground, seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika, then stuffed into a natural casing before being lightly smoked over beechwood. The result is a deep reddish-brown sausage with a firm, juicy bite and a subtle smokiness that enhances its rich, meaty taste. Traditionally, Frankfurter Rindswurst is heated in hot water rather than grilled, preserving its natural juiciness and preventing the casing from splitting. It is typically served with mustard, freshly baked bread, or potato salad, though it is also enjoyed in hot dogs or sliced into stews and soups. Today, Frankfurter Rindswurst remains a specialty of Frankfurt, where it is a staple at butcher shops, market stalls, and local taverns. "
Welfenspeise,"Welfenspeise or Welf pudding is a traditional dessert originating from Hanover. The dessert is named after the Welfen or Guelphs, which were once one of the most powerful dynasties of Europe, and their colors are yellow and white, just like this layered dessert that consists of two parts – one is white, and the other yellow. The white part is made with a combination of egg whites, cornstarch, milk, vanilla, sugar, and salt. The mixture is poured into a glass bowl and it’s left to chill. The yellow part is made with egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, dry white wine, and cornstarch. The mixture is passed through a sieve and poured on top of the white base."
Semmelschmarrn,"Semmelschmarrn is a sweet and buttery bread pudding and a traditional Bavarian dessert. The preparation is fairly simple - stale bread is first soaked in milk, then mixed with eggs and sugar and cooked in butter. The mix is usually flavored with cinnamon, but vanilla extract can also be used. The dessert is served warm, and it's recommended to pair it with stewed plums, applesauce, compotes, ice cream, and fresh fruit. Because of the basic ingredients and the simple preparation process, semmelscharrn was once considered poor man’s food."
Schwarzsauer,"This traditional German blood soup has its origins in the northern parts of the country and is typically associated with the Schleswig-Holstein region. It was mainly prepared during pig slaughter, when fresh blood was collected and cooked with pork, vinegar, onions, and spices such as bay leaves, peppercorns, and cloves. Though it is rarely found on restaurant menus, it is considered a delicacy that usually comes served alongside potatoes or dumplings."
Fliederbeersuppe,"Fliederbeersuppe is a traditional soup mainly associated with the northern regions of the country. The main ingredient for the soup are elderberries (or elderberry juice), which give the soup its rich color. The elderberries are cooked to let out the juice, which is then mixed with apple juice, lemon juice, lemon zest, cut apples, cornstarch, and sugar. The mix is occasionally spiced with cinnamon or garlic. This sweet soup is served warm with homemade grits dumplings."
Milzwurst,"Milzwurst is a regional German sausage primarily associated with the Bavarian and Swabian parts of southern Germany. It is a specialty made using a blend of cooked spleen, typically from veal or pork, combined with other finely ground meats such as beef, pork, and offal, enriched with breadcrumbs, eggs, onions, and seasoned with a mild mix of herbs and spices. The resulting mixture is encased in a natural casing, usually pork intestine, and then cooked or steamed until firm. Unlike more commonly known sausages, Milzwurst has a soft, somewhat moist texture and a flavor that is savory yet restrained, showcasing the character of organ meat without overwhelming the palate. Its origins are rooted in rural meat processing practices, where no part of the animal was wasted and recipes were developed to create nourishing and flavorful food from lesser-used cuts. Milzwurst is often prepared and consumed as part of a warm meal rather than as a cold cut. It is typically sliced and pan-fried in butter or lard, sometimes breaded before frying, and served alongside sauerkraut or potato-based side dishes. Though not widely available outside its core regions, it holds cultural significance in areas where butchery and local sausage-making remain closely tied to community food heritage. "
Schlesisches Himmelreich,"Schlesisches Himmelreich or Silesian heaven is a traditional dish originating from Silesia. It consists of smoked pork that is gently simmered with dried fruits such as pears, apples, and prunes. It's traditionally accompanied by kartoffelklöße potato dumplings that are simmered in the same pot until they float on top. The combination of smoky meats and tart, sweet-sour fruits was beloved in the past with the early Silesian settlers, but nowadays the dish is made just occasionally in very few households. There are a few variations on the dish – one uses stewed pie melon flavored with cinnamon, currants, and lemon rind instead of the stewed dried fruits, and another one served the pork with sweetened stewed quinces."
Aepfel im Schlafrock,"Jabuke u šlafroku is a traditional, old dish that is a typical representative of Croatian comfort food. It is prepared by dipping thinly sliced apples in a batter consisting of flour, eggs, milk, and vanilla sugar. The concoction is then fried in hot oil until the apples turn golden-brown on the exterior. After frying, the apples are often dusted with cinnamon or powdered sugar for extra flavor. The unusual name of the dish means apples in a bathrobe, referring to the fact that the apples are 'dressed' in a crispy external layer. And although it's not a traditional pairing, it's recommended to serve the dish with vanilla sauce on the side. In Germany, the same dish, but usually made with whole peeled apples is called Äpfel im Schlafrock, and the apples are sometimes filled with apricots or peaches."
Schnuesch,"Schnüsch is a traditional stew or vegetable stew originating from the northern parts of the country. It’s made with a combination of carrots, potatoes, kohlrabi, green beans, peas, stock, parsley, milk, flour, sweet cream, salt, and pepper. The stew is simmered until all the ingredients have become tender, but still slightly firm to the bite and not falling apart. Schnüsch is traditionally sprinkled with chopped parsley and served with slices of raw ham."
Rostbraetel,"Rostbrätel is a traditional dish originating from the region of Thuringia. The dish is made with a combination of pork neck, onions, mustard, salt, pepper, garlic, butter, and dark beer. The sliced pork neck is tenderized and marinated in salt, pepper, mustard, onions, and dark beer. It is then grilled over charcoal, and as it cooks, the meat is basted with the marinade. Once done, rostbrätel is topped with pan-fried onions and garlic before serving. It’s recommended to pair the dish with a glass of dark beer and serve it with bread rolls or potato salad on the side as accompaniments."
Helgolaender knieper,"Helgoländer knieper are cooked claws of the brown crab, a specialty of Helgoland, a tiny German island in the North Sea located some 70 km off the coast of Germany. This barren and rocky patch of land has been most famous for lobster fishing, but lobster has all but disappeared since World War II. In contrast, the population of brown crabs (or edible crabs) has been steadily rising, so nowadays, this crustacean is one of the island's main exports. While still on the boat, fishermen remove the claws and use the body for bait. The claws are later cooked in seawater, a traditional method of preparing kniepers (which literally means claws). Once done, the claws are either smashed with a hammer or a crab leg cracker, and a special seafood fork is used to scrape the meat out of the shell. Helgoländer knieper are usually paired with some fresh bread, butter, and various dips, like curry, garlic sauce, or dill and cognac. "
Ente in Bier,"Ente in bier is a traditional duck-based dish originating from Germany. The dish is usually made with a combination of duck, dark beer, chicken stock, garlic, butter, flour, marjoram, onions, anchovy paste, parsley, celery, lemon zest, bay leaves, thyme, and salt. The duck is cut into pieces, seasoned with salt, and dredged in flour before it's browned in butter on all sides.

Bruckbam,"Bruckbam is a regional Bavarian dish made of thick potato noodles that are cooked in the oven, prepared in parts of southern Germany where potato-based specialties have long been staples of rural cooking. The name is less widely known outside local communities, but the dish itself reflects the broader Bavarian preference for simple, hearty meals that combine potatoes, flour, and basic seasonings. The preparation begins by making a dense dough from cooked, riced potatoes mixed with flour, eggs, and salt. This dough is shaped into thick, short noodle-like pieces, which are arranged in a greased baking dish. Once formed, the potato noodles are either baked on their own until golden or moistened lightly with broth or milk to keep them soft. Some versions add small pieces of bacon or onions on top to infuse the dish with more flavor as it bakes. The result is a satisfying combination of a tender interior with lightly crisped edges. Bruckbam is typically served hot, often alongside braised meats, sausages, or simple salads. The dish is most common in rural households, where it has been valued as a way to make use of leftover potatoes and stretch them into a filling main or side course. In some Bavarian villages, Bruckbam is still prepared in wood-fired ovens, which give the crust a distinctive aroma. "
Verheiratete,"Hailing from Saarland, verheiratete is a combination of boiled potatoes, flour-based dumplings, and a creamy bacon sauce. This simple German dish is known by the names of verheiratete and geheirate (also geheiratete or geheirade), both with the same meaning of married, the married ones, or a married couple. The name refers to the act of joining or marrying separate ingredients together into one meal, just like when two people are united together in marriage. In Saarland, this dish used to be a part of the poor people’s diet due to the simple, everyday ingredients of which it consists. Over the years, the dish evolved into a comfort food beloved by everyone."
Kartoffelschmarrn,"Kartoffelschmarrn is a traditional and Bavarian dish, resembling a savory potato pancake or scramble.

Saure Kutteln,"Saure Kutteln is a sour tripe stew originating from Baden-Württemberg, a region in southwestern Germany. This dish features tender strips of beef stomach simmered in a tangy vinegar-based sauce, balancing the rich texture of the tripe with a refreshing acidity. The preparation includes slow cooking the tripe after thorough cleaning, then gently simmering it with vinegar, broth, sautéed onions, and aromatic spices such as bay leaves, juniper berries, and peppercorns. Saure Kutteln reflects the culinary traditions of Baden-Württemberg, where resourcefulness and hearty flavors are valued, turning offal into a satisfying and flavorful meal. The history of Saure Kutteln is tied to the rural communities of the region, where cooks made use of all parts of the animal and developed dishes that were both economical and nourishing. This sour tripe stew stands apart from other offal dishes through its distinctive acidic profile, which helps to tenderize the meat and enhance its flavor. Once a common dish in home kitchens, it now finds a place mainly in local taverns and specialty restaurants that preserve the region’s gastronomic heritage. The dish is typically served hot, accompanied by hearty sides like crusty bread or boiled potatoes that absorb the flavorful sauce. "
Puddingbrezel,"Puddingbrezel is a sweet pastry originating in Germany, where it is commonly found in bakeries across southern and western regions. The name translates to “pudding pretzel,” reflecting both its distinctive shape and the creamy filling that defines it. The dough is usually a rich, buttery yeast dough similar to Danish pastry, prepared by layering the dough with fat to create a light, flaky texture. Once the dough has been rolled out and folded, it is cut into strips and twisted into a figure-eight or pretzel shape. Before baking, the pastry is filled with a smooth vanilla custard that sits in the central loops of the form. During baking, the custard sets into a firm, glossy layer while the pastry develops a golden brown surface. After cooling, the Puddingbrezel is often finished with a thin sugar glaze to enhance sweetness and give it a slight sheen. The combination of buttery dough and soft vanilla filling makes it popular as a midmorning snack or an accompaniment to coffee. Unlike some filled pastries, the custard in a Puddingbrezel is applied raw and baked along with the dough, so it becomes integrated into the structure rather than added afterward. Puddingbrezel can be found in many German bakeries year-round, and although recipes are similar, small variations exist in the proportions of butter, sugar, and custard thickness. Some bakers use a richer pastry base while others prefer a lighter version with more pronounced layers. The shape is always recognizable, with the custard filling arranged symmetrically in the loops. Because the dough is laminated, it requires careful handling and enough resting time to develop the right texture without becoming tough."
Schusterjunge,"Schusterjunge (lit. cobbler's apprentice) is a traditional bread roll originating from Berlin. The bread rolls are usually made with a combination of rye flour, wheat flour, yeast or baking powder, salt, caraway seeds, and beer. The flours are mixed with yeast or baking powder, salt, and caraway seeds. Beer is added gradually, and the smooth dough is then shaped into small round rolls. The dough is dipped in caraway seeds and coarse salt before the rye rolls are baked until brown."
Backerbsensuppe,"Backerbsensuppe is an Austrian and southern German soup made with small, round, fried dough pieces known as Backerbsen, served floating in a clear broth. The name translates literally to “baked peas,” although the dumplings are not made from peas but from a batter of flour, eggs, milk, and seasonings that is fried until golden and crisp. The dish is particularly associated with Austria and Bavaria, where soups play a central role in meals, often served as a first course before heartier dishes. Its origins are linked to the broader Central European habit of enriching simple broths with dumplings or small additions that turned them into more filling fare. Backerbsen were developed as a way to provide texture and substance without requiring fresh bread at the table, as they could be fried in advance and stored for long periods. Over time, they became a recognizable accompaniment in their own right, sold in bakeries and shops as well as prepared at home. Preparation begins with making a thick batter of flour, eggs, and milk, sometimes with a pinch of baking powder to give the dough a slight lift. The batter is dropped in tiny portions into hot fat and fried until small golden balls form, which are then drained and cooled. When added to a bowl of clear beef or vegetable broth, the Backerbsen soften slightly on the outside while keeping a bit of crunch within. The contrast between the light broth and the fried dumplings defines the appeal of the dish. Backerbsen are often prepared in large batches and kept in airtight containers, making them a convenient pantry item to transform a simple broth into a recognizable soup. This storage-friendly quality gave them a place in rural households where cooking was done less frequently in bulk, and they are still sold packaged in Austrian and German supermarkets today. Backerbsensuppe is eaten in homes and restaurants across Austria and Bavaria, usually served as a starter at family meals, in Gasthäuser, and at festive gatherings."
Saure Nieren,"Saure Nieren is a German dish made using pig's kidneys simmered in a tangy, vinegar-based sauce. This preparation highlights the distinct flavors of kidneys, balancing their rich, earthy taste with the sharpness of vinegar and the sweetness of onions. The kidneys are carefully cleaned and simmered until tender, then sliced and cooked in a sauce composed of vinegar, broth, sautéed onions, and a blend of spices including bay leaves and peppercorns. A subtle hint of sugar is often added to mellow the acidity of the vinegar and to harmonize the overall taste. This slow cooking process allows the flavors to meld, softening the intensity of the kidneys while maintaining the characteristic tang of the dish. Saure Nieren is served warm, traditionally accompanied by sides such as boiled potatoes, crusty rye bread, or dumplings, which help absorb the flavorful sauce. It remains a popular dish in German households and specialty restaurants, especially in areas with a strong appreciation for offal-based cuisine. "
Auszogne,"Kiachl is a traditional pastry from the Tyrol region in Austria. It's a type of fried yeast dough pastry often enjoyed during the Christmas season and at local festivals. When making kiachl, a yeasted dough is left to rise, then shaped into a round, flat form with a depression in the middle. The dough is then deep-fried in hot lard or oil until golden brown. After frying, kiachl can be served as a sweet and savory, depending on the topping. Sweet kiachl is dusted with powdered sugar and often served with a side of cranberry jam or other fruit compote. Savory kiachl is typically served with sauerkraut, making for a hearty, satisfying dish. "
Kartoffelkaese,"Kartoffelkäse is a creamy potato-based spread that originates from the southern regions of Germany, particularly Bavaria and Upper Austria (where it's called Erdäpfelkäse), where it is often served in beer gardens and at countryside gatherings. Despite its name, which translates to ""potato cheese,"" the dish contains no actual cheese; instead, it refers to the smooth, spreadable texture that resembles soft cheese. Made primarily from boiled and mashed potatoes mixed with sour cream or quark, finely chopped onions, chives, and mild seasonings, kartoffelkäse is a savory, tangy, and lightly fluffy accompaniment commonly enjoyed with rye bread, pretzels, or as a cold side to meats and sausages. Its origins lie in agrarian communities where potatoes were a dietary staple and dairy products like quark were readily available from local farms. The preparation is uncomplicated, requiring only the gentle blending of starchy potatoes with the creamy base, then chilled slightly to allow the flavors to meld. Each household might have its own version, varying the proportions of cream, the type of onion used, or the presence of additions like caraway seeds or fresh herbs. Served cold or at room temperature, kartoffelkäse is a common sight at buffets, seasonal festivals, and wine tastings across southern Germany and Austria. It pairs especially well with sourdough or Bauernbrot and often accompanies a glass of local beer or white wine. "
Bauernbratwurst,"Bauernbratwurst, which translates to ""farmer’s bratwurst"", is a traditional sausage known for its rustic and hearty flavor. It is typically made from coarsely ground pork, though some variations may include a mixture of pork and beef. The meat is seasoned with a blend of spices such as garlic, pepper, marjoram, paprika and sometimes onion or nutmeg. What distinguishes Bauernbratwurst from other bratwurst varieties is its rustic, country-style preparation. The sausage has a coarser texture than finer bratwursts and is often smoked, which gives it a deeper, richer flavor. This sausage is often associated with rural areas, where it has historically been made by farmers using traditional sausage-making methods. Bauernbratwurst is typically cooked by grilling or pan-frying, which helps develop its savory flavor and crispy exterior. It is usually served with classic German accompaniments such as sauerkraut, potatoes, mustard, or simply with bread."
Coburger Bratwurst,"Coburger Bratwurst is a distinctive type of German sausage originating from the town of Coburg in northern Bavaria. Known for its pale color and fine texture, this sausage is traditionally made from coarsely ground pork and veal combined with a blend of spices including salt, pepper, marjoram and nutmeg. Its unique preparation and seasoning result in a mild but flavorful sausage that stands apart from other regional bratwurst varieties. Coburger Bratwurst is commonly grilled over pinecones or hardwood, which imparts a subtle smoky aroma that complements its delicate taste and adds to its culinary appeal. The history of Coburger Bratwurst dates back several centuries, with the sausage gaining official recognition in the early 15th century. Its recipe has been carefully preserved and guarded by local butchers in Coburg, contributing to its reputation as a specialty of the region. The connection between the sausage and the town is strong, with the sausage serving as a symbol of local pride and craftsmanship. Over time, Coburger Bratwurst has become a popular delicacy not only in Coburg but throughout Bavaria and Germany, enjoyed by those who appreciate the balance of simplicity and flavor in regional sausages. Preparation of Coburger Bratwurst involves selecting high-quality veal and pork shoulder and backfat, grinding the meat coarsely, and mixing it with the signature spice blend. The mixture is then stuffed into natural pork casings and shaped into sausages approximately 15 to 20 centimeters in length. The sausages are traditionally cooked on a grill over pinecones or hardwood, which enhances the flavor with subtle smokiness while ensuring a juicy interior and a lightly crisped exterior. The careful balance of seasoning and the distinctive grilling method contribute to the sausage’s characteristic mild yet aromatic profile. Coburger Bratwurst is typically served hot, often accompanied by mustard, freshly baked bread rolls, and a side of sauerkraut or potato salad. It is a common feature at local festivals, markets, and beer gardens where it is enjoyed as a snack or meal. "
Hoppelpoppel,"Hoppelpoppel is a traditional dish originating from Berlin. The dish is usually made with a combination of boiled potatoes, butter or olive oil, onions, bell peppers, eggs, milk, parsley, and pork loin or salami. This popular way to use leftovers is made in a skillet – the potatoes, vegetables, and meat are fried in butter or olive oil, and the eggs, parsley, and milk are poured over the mixture until the eggs are set but still moist. The dish is served on a large platter, usually garnished with tomatoes and pickles. Hoppelpoppel also often appears on Midwestern diner menus in the United States."
Sauerampfersuppe,"Sauerampfersuppe is a traditional soup originating from the southern parts of the country. The soup is usually made with a combination of sorrel, shallots, butter, flour, chicken stock, heavy cream, egg yolks, salt, and black pepper.

The two are mixed together with sour cream, milk, eggs, seasonings, and the white starch from the cooking liquid. The batter is poured into a greased loaf pan, dotted with butter, and baked until browned and crisp. Once cooled, the loaf is typically cut into thin slices and sautéed in butter on both sides before it's served hot. Potthucke is traditionally washed down with schnapps or beer. This savory cake has many variations, so it can also contain ingredients such as bacon and onions."
Blunzengroestl,"   Blunzengröstl is a traditional Bavarian and Austrian dish made by frying pieces of blood sausage (Blunzen) with onions and often potatoes.

Sometimes, apples or vinegar are included to provide a bit of tanginess that balances the richness of the sausage. Blunzengröstl is usually served hot and can be enjoyed as a main course or a hearty snack.    "
Roeggelchen,"Röggelchen is a traditional bread roll, particularly popular in the Rhineland region. It is made from a mix of rye and wheat flour, giving it a dense, hearty texture and a slightly sour flavor due to the rye content. The rolls are typically small, oval-shaped, and often baked in pairs, where two rolls are attached at the sides. Röggelchen has a chewy crust and a soft interior, making it perfect for sandwiches, often served with hearty fillings like cured meats, cheese, or butter. In the Rhineland, it's commonly eaten with Halve Hahn, a local dish consisting of a Röggelchen with cheese, mustard, onions, and pickles."
Hamburger Aalsuppe,"Hamburger Aalsuppe is a traditional eel soup originating from Hamburg. In the past, several hundred years ago, it contained no eel and was in fact called aol suppe in northern German dialect, which means all soup, referring to the leftover ingredients such as ham bones and old fruits and vegetables. To Germans outside of the Hamburg area, aol sounded like Aal, meaning eel, so they complained that the eel was missing from the soup. That was the case until the late 18th century, when smart cooks started to add the eel to the broth, doubling the price of the soup in the process. There is no fixed recipe for the soup, but the base is always prepared with a clear ham broth that's flavored with vinegar and sugar, giving it contrasting flavors. The usual ingredients include carrots, leeks, dried plums, apples and pears, knödel dumplings, and spices such as thyme, coriander, marjoram, and sage. The eel is sliced thinly, then added into the pot at the last moment. In order to balance the sweetness of this soup, it's recommended to pair it with a dry white wine such as Rheingau or a bottle of beer. Interestingly, if the soup is nowadays prepared without the eel, it's called Verlorene Aalsuppe (lost eel soup)."
Saures Luengerl,"Saures Lüngerl is an offal dish from Bavaria and Austria, made primarily from veal lung and often heart, cooked in a tangy, vinegar-based sauce. The name translates to “sour little lung,” directly referencing its main ingredient and flavor profile. Originating in the rural kitchens of southern Germany and Austria, Saures Lüngerl reflects a time-honored commitment to nose-to-tail cooking, where every part of the animal is used and transformed into nourishing meals. The dish is prepared by thoroughly cleaning and simmering veal lungs, sometimes with heart, in a seasoned broth made from water, vinegar, onions, and a bouquet of warming spices such as bay leaves, marjoram, peppercorns, and allspice. Once the organs are tender, they are sliced into thin strips and returned to the strained broth. The liquid is then thickened with a light roux, made from butter and flour, into a sauce that’s tangy, aromatic, and velvety. A final touch of cream or sour cream is sometimes stirred in to soften the acidity and add richness. The result is a flavorful ragout with a distinctive sour note that balances the intensity of the offal and the earthiness of the spices. Traditionally, Saures Lüngerl is served hot with Semmelknödel, the classic Bavarian bread dumplings that soak up the sauce and provide a soft, pillowy contrast to the tender strips of meat. The dish is typically enjoyed as a main course and is especially popular in colder months, when its robust flavors and warming qualities are most appreciated. It is a staple in many Gasthäuser across Bavaria and Austria, where it is cherished not only as a meal but also as a symbol of culinary heritage."
Luebecker Marzipantorte,"Lübecker marzipantorte is a traditional cake made with a rich combination of marzipan, sponge cake, and often fruit preserves or chocolate. Originating from the city of Lübeck, which is renowned for its high-quality marzipan, this cake is a luxurious dessert that showcases the region's confectionery expertise. The sponge cake layers are typically sandwiched with a generous spread of marzipan and sometimes a layer of jam or mousse to enhance the flavor. The entire cake is usually covered in a smooth layer of marzipan, often decorated with intricate designs or toasted almonds. Lübecker marzipantorte is a popular treat during festive occasions, particularly around Christmas and Easter. Its delicate almond flavor and decadent texture make it a favorite among marzipan lovers. "
Seele,"Seele is a traditional bread originating from Baden-Württemberg. The bread is usually made with a combination of wheat flour, spelt flour, yeast, salt, and water, without any additives or baking aids. Over the course of 24 hours, the dough is worked by hand several times. The small and oblong hand-shaped loaves are placed on the oven floor and the bread is baked until the crumb is moist and the crust is crisp. The crust is sprinkled with caraway seeds and coarse salt. Nowadays, only a few artisanal bakeries in the area still bake the bread using this traditional method that results in toasted aromas of the bread. Many bakeries use modern methods – the loaves are processed by machines, and the bread is less moist, while the crust is less crisp. The name seele means souls, and although the origin of the name is unclear, it's believed that it comes from the Christian All Souls' Day, when bread was given to poor people (souls) in need."
Hollerkuecherl,"Hollerkücherl is a Bavarian dessert made by dipping elderflower clusters in batter and frying them until golden and crisp. It comes from southern Germany, especially regions of Bavaria and Upper Austria, where elderflowers bloom in late spring and early summer. The name combines “Holler,” the Bavarian word for elder, and “Kücherl,” meaning a small cake or fritter. To prepare the dish, fresh elderflower umbels are harvested when the blossoms are fully opened but still fragrant. The flowers are lightly shaken to remove any insects or debris, then held by their stems and dipped into a smooth batter made of flour, eggs, milk, and sometimes a splash of schnapps or sparkling water to lighten the texture. Once coated, the flowers are lowered into hot oil or clarified butter and fried briefly until the batter sets and becomes pale golden. The finished fritters are drained and dusted with powdered sugar. They are served warm, often with a wedge of lemon or a side of fruit preserves. Hollerkücherl are most commonly eaten as a dessert or a sweet afternoon snack, and they appear in many small inns and family kitchens during elderflower season. Because the flowers have a delicate aroma, the batter is kept simple so their floral character is not overwhelmed by heavy flavoring. Cooks sometimes enhance the batter with a pinch of cinnamon or grated lemon zest. The fritters should be eaten soon after frying because they lose their crispness over time. The process of picking and cleaning the blossoms is considered part of the enjoyment, since it connects the dish to the rhythm of the countryside and the short period when the flowers are in perfect condition. Elderflowers are also used for syrups, cordials, and jellies, but frying them in batter remains one of the most direct ways to enjoy their scent and taste. "
Frankfurter Brenten,"This traditional Christmas cookie originated in Frankfurt, and it has a long history that dates back to the Middle Ages. Although the recipes may vary, these cookies are usually prepared with a soft dough that incorporates marzipan, orange blossom or rose water, sugar or honey, and flour. Traditionally, the cakes are formed into squares, and the top is usually imprinted with different patterns or comes decorated with almond halves. Frankfurter Brenten cookies are nowadays mostly available during Christmastime."
Bamberger Zwiebeln,"Bamberger Zwiebeln is a regional Franconian specialty from the historic city of Bamberg in northern Bavaria, that consists of large hollowed-out onions filled with a savory meat mixture, typically composed of minced pork or a blend of pork and beef, seasoned with herbs, spices, and usually breadcrumbs or eggs to bind. Once stuffed, the onions are slow-roasted or braised until tender, then often finished in a rich beer gravy made with dark Franconian beer, which imparts a slightly sweet, malty depth to the dish. The result is a comforting and flavorful combination of sweet, soft onion and hearty, well-seasoned meat, often served with potato dumplings or mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce. This dish is closely linked to the culinary identity of Bamberg, a city known not only for its medieval architecture and UNESCO World Heritage status but also for its smoked beer and robust regional cuisine. Bamberger Zwiebeln is typically enjoyed in local taverns and beer halls. The use of beer in the cooking liquid is not merely a flavor enhancer but also a nod to the area’s rich beer culture, especially its rauchbier, which usually finds its way into the sauce. "
Stockwurst,"Stockwurst is a mild, finely textured German sausage historically produced across southern regions such as Bavaria, where it has been appreciated for its smooth consistency and clean flavor. The recipe relies primarily on finely ground beef blended with a smaller proportion of pork fat to achieve the desired tenderness. The mixture is seasoned gently with salt, white pepper, and mace, and sometimes flavored with hints of fresh herbs or a touch of cardamom. Unlike smoked sausages, Stockwurst is cooked by blanching, which helps it retain a pale color and delicate taste. The production process begins with very finely minced beef, which is mixed until it reaches a uniform, emulsified texture. The prepared meat is stuffed into natural casings, shaped into short, plump links, and simmered carefully until cooked through. This method keeps the casing tender and the filling moist without overpowering the natural beef flavor. Stockwurst has traditionally been served warm, reheated gently in hot water to preserve its smooth texture, and accompanied by mild mustard, crusty bread, or potato salad. It is sometimes eaten cold in sandwiches or sliced onto salads, but warm preparation is more common. In many ways, it resembles Weißwurst, although its higher proportion of beef and less pronounced seasoning set it apart. Today, Stockwurst has become less widespread than in the past and is rarely found in large supermarkets or mass production. It survives mainly through small local butchers and specialty shops, which continue to prepare it using time-tested methods and fresh regional meat. The decline in everyday consumption is partly due to changing eating habits and the rise of more widely marketed sausage varieties. Despite this, Stockwurst retains a modest but loyal following among customers who appreciate its subtle flavor and soft texture. "
Radi,"Radi is a traditional snack originating from Bavaria. The snack is made by spiralizing a radish, then sprinkling it with salt, and sometimes ground pepper and chives. This radish-based snack is always served with beer and it’s eaten with the fingers. A German pretzel on the side is also a common option. The type of radish used for radi should be the locally grown Munich beer radish. Radi is especially popular during the famous Oktoberfest."
Kloppschinken,"Kloppschinken is a traditional dish originating from Uckermark. The dish is usually made with a combination of ham (boiled or smoked), milk, nutmeg, eggs, breadcrumbs, and oil. The ham is marinated in a mixture of milk and nutmeg, dried, pounded, and dipped into beaten eggs and breadcrumbs. Both sides of the ham slices should be well coated. The slices of breaded ham are then fried in oil on each side until golden. The dish is served while still hot and it's often paired with applesauce. In the past, this was a special treat that was prepared on Sundays and holidays."
Woihinkelche,"Woihinkelche is a traditional chicken dish originating from the Rheingau wine-growing area, north of Mainz. It's usually made with a combination of chicken, onions, garlic, cream, butter, mushrooms, white grapes, dry white wine (Riesling is preferred), salt, pepper, oil, and tarragon. The chicken is cut into pieces and rubbed with salt, pepper, and tarragon before it's browned in a pan on all sides. The onions, garlic, and wine are added to the pan and the dish is cooked over low heat. The chicken is removed, and cream is whisked into the sauce until it thickens. The mushrooms are sautéed in butter and added to the sauce along with the chicken. The grapes are added to the pan, the dish is seasoned with salt and pepper, and it's then served hot, ideally with cooked white rice on the side."
Berliner Schmorgurken,"Berliner schmorgurken is a traditional dish originating from Berlin. The dish is usually made with a combination of cucumbers, white wine vinegar, bacon, shallots, sour cream, dill, sugar, salt, and pepper. The cucumbers are peeled, cut in half lengthwise, and the seeds are removed. They're cut into pieces and tossed with sugar, salt, pepper, and vinegar, and then left to stand for an hour. The bacon and shallots are sautéed over medium heat, and the drained cucumbers are added to the pan. The mixture is covered with water and simmered over low heat. Sour cream is stirred in when the pan is removed from the heat, and the dish is then reheated, but not boiled. Before serving, schmorgurken are seasoned with salt and pepper and sprinkled with finely chopped fresh dill."
Meissner Fummel,"Legend has it that, in the 18th century, a messenger of the Electorate of Saxony regularly frequented Dresden and Meissen. The courier was a bit too fond of the famous Meissen wine, and he would drink so much that he would be unable to carry out his duties. The Elector then ordered the bakers of Meissner to invent a cake that was so fragile it would break at the slightest vibration, and the Fummel was created. Meissner Fummel is an elongated, tapered, hollow, and extremely fragile pastry. The pastry is paper-thin and extremely brittle with no specific flavor, and therefore it has no appreciable nutritional value. However, it's often dusted with powdered sugar, and the flakes are then enjoyed as a sweet treat with a cup of coffee. This legendary pastry is especially popular as a souvenir."
Mutschel,"Mutschel is a star-shaped yeast bread that originates from Reutlingen, a city in the Swabian region of Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. This baked specialty is easily recognized by its distinctive eight-pointed form and is deeply tied to local customs that date back centuries. Though it resembles other festive breads in appearance, Mutschel is unique in how it is woven into the cultural life of Reutlingen, especially during the annual celebration known as Mutscheltag. Historical references to Mutschel stretch back to at least the Middle Ages. Bakers and citizens in Reutlingen began making this bread in association with guild traditions and communal feasting. Over time, Mutschel became an emblem of civic pride. Each year on the Thursday after Epiphany, locals gather to play dice games where winners receive Mutschel loaves as prizes. The symbolism of the star shape is often linked to the Star of Bethlehem, but it is also said to reflect aspects of the city’s heraldry or references to bakers’ guild insignias. Preparing Mutschel involves an enriched yeast dough made from flour, butter, eggs, milk, a little sugar, and a pinch of salt. Once the dough is kneaded until smooth and pliable, it is left to rise until doubled in volume. Bakers then shape the loaf into its characteristic star with a central dome surrounded by triangular points carefully cut and pulled outward. After a second rising, the loaf is brushed with egg wash to develop a golden crust and then baked until cooked through and lightly browned. Mutschel can be served fresh and slightly warm or cooled to room temperature. It is usually eaten plain, though it can also be accompanied by butter, jam, or cold cuts. During Mutscheltag festivities, participants gather around tables with dice and compete in games to win the bread, reinforcing a sense of local identity and camaraderie. Bakeries across the city produce thousands of these star breads every January, and families consider it an essential part of marking the beginning of the year. Visitors often purchase Mutschel as an edible souvenir that captures a unique aspect of Swabian heritage."

Schwaebische Brezel,"Schwäbische Brezel is a soft pretzel from the Swabian region of southern Germany, distinguished by its distinctive looped shape, deep brown crust, and soft, chewy interior. Originating in the historical region of Swabia, and most commonly eaten in Baden-Württemberg, this pretzel is a staple of local bakeries and beer gardens, often enjoyed with butter, cheese spreads, or sausages. The dough is made from wheat flour, yeast, water, and salt, and is briefly dipped in a lye solution before baking, which gives the crust its characteristic glossy surface and malty flavor. Unlike its Bavarian counterpart, the Swabian pretzel typically features a thinner, crispier loop and a plumper bottom, offering a contrast in texture that makes it especially popular for sandwiches or snacks. The surface is usually sprinkled with coarse salt, though variations may include sesame or poppy seeds. In Swabia, pretzels are more than just a bakery item, they are a daily food enjoyed across all age groups, from school lunches to breakfast and beer-time accompaniments. Their presence in the region is so prominent that many bakeries specialize in perfecting the shape and balance between crust and crumb, with some even marking their dough to control the spread during baking. The method of scoring the thicker bottom part of the pretzel before baking is a hallmark of the Swabian style, resulting in a satisfying bite that pairs well with savory toppings. "

Bayerischer Krautsalat,"Bayerischer Krautsalat is a tangy and refreshing cabbage salad from Bavaria in southern Germany, known for its simple preparation and robust flavor profile that balances acidity, sweetness, and spice. Made primarily from finely shredded white cabbage, this salad is typically marinated in a warm dressing of vinegar, oil, salt, sugar, and caraway seeds, often enhanced with a touch of onion or a splash of broth to add depth. The cabbage is usually kneaded or lightly salted before marinating to soften its texture and release its natural juices, allowing the dressing to be fully absorbed. Served chilled or at room temperature, Bayerischer Krautsalat is a staple accompaniment in Bavarian cuisine, particularly alongside roasted meats, sausages, or schnitzel. Its roots lie in the agrarian cooking of Bavaria, where cabbage was a reliable and long-lasting ingredient, especially during colder months. Krautsalat offered a way to enjoy vegetables even when fresh produce was scarce, and its acidity helped cut through the richness of pork-heavy meals. The caraway seeds lend a warm, slightly nutty flavor that is characteristic of many German salads and breads, while the balance of sweet and sour reflects the broader culinary style of the region. This salad is commonly found in beer gardens, local taverns, and home kitchens across Bavaria, and while variations exist throughout Germany, the Bavarian version is noted for its clarity of flavor and straightforward ingredients.

It is commonly consumed as a breakfast or afternoon bread, often enjoyed plain, with butter, or paired with jam and cheese. The preparation of Anisbreze typically uses wheat flour, fresh yeast or sourdough starter, milk, butter, and eggs, resulting in a rich, slightly sweet dough.

The crust is usually pale golden rather than deeply browned, and the texture is soft rather than chewy, making it closer in character to enriched breakfast rolls than to firm pretzels. Anisbreze is often associated with festive occasions or seasonal baking, particularly during the Easter period in some parts of Swabia, though it is also available year-round in bakeries that continue to specialize in regional recipes.
